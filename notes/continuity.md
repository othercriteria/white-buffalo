# Continuity Notes

## Current State (post-expansion, pre-revision)

### Word count: ~34,300 words

### Structure:
- Part One: Ch 1-3, JE I-II (Aldridge commissions Farrell, journey begins)
- Part Two: Ch 4-6, JE III-V (Platte corridor, trading post, finds empty homestead)
- Part Three: Ch 7-8, JE VI-VII (Investigation, graves, torn page, tracking north)
- Part Four: Ch 9-12, JE VIII-IX (DTs peak, Morrow's death, Lakota departure)

### Recent changes:
- Removed hired hand / Thomas Carver (two graves, not three)
- Added land-friction passages:
  - Ch 4: Storm night, frostbite, talking to horse
  - Ch 5: Six-day journey, wrong creek, ice crossing, coyotes
  - Ch 6: Ice sounds at homestead
  - Ch 8: Horse exhaustion, cottonwood bark, failed hunt
  - Ch 9: Soundscape ("silence was not silent")

### Key continuity points:
- Farrell: alcoholic, Mexican War veteran (Chapultepec), Scots-Irish PA background
- Morrow: also Mexican War veteran (Buena Vista, Mississippi Rifles implied), Virginia
- Both shaped by war, both hollowed out, different responses to emptiness
- Hardins: George and Catherine, killed late summer 1858, buried behind barn
- White buffalo: female, followed by Morrow since calf (spring 1856)
- Lakota at end: Brulé band, leading white buffalo to Black Hills

### Timeline:
- Journal entries: April 1856 → undated final entry (morning of death)
- Farrell's journey: November 1858 → early February 1859
- Final chapter: same day as Morrow's death, Lakota perspective

### Voice consistency:
- Farrell: plain, direct, increasingly fragmented in Part Four
- Morrow: formal, biblical cadence, grows calmer toward end
- Chapter 12: third person, distant, observational, no interiority

### Ambiguities (intentional):
- Lakota at end: real or hallucination? (left open)
- Farrell's survival: unclear (fragments of rescue, then silence)
- Whether Farrell ever returns to Aldridge

### Revision priorities:
- Check anachronisms (period language)
- Verify geography/timeline consistency
- Voice consistency across both narrators
- Ensure expansions integrate smoothly
