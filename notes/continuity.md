# Continuity Notes

## Current State (post-revision)

### Word count: ~34,500 words

### Structure:
- Part One: Ch 1-3, JE I-II (Aldridge commissions Farrell, journey begins)
- Part Two: Ch 4-6, JE III-V (Platte corridor, trading post, finds empty homestead)
- Part Three: Ch 7-8, JE VI-VII (Investigation, graves, tracks north)
- Part Four: Ch 9-12, JE VIII-IX (DTs peak, Morrow's death, Lakota departure)

### Recent changes (this revision):
- Timeline clarified: Hardins married summer 1855, arrived early 1856, survived two winters
- "Two years ago" → "nearly three years ago" in Ch 1
- Added childlessness thread: Aldridge's concern (Ch 1), Farrell notices absence in letters (Ch 2), confirmed at homestead (Ch 6)
- Fixed trader inconsistency: "once, early on" → "a few times" (Ch 5)
- Removed journal page contrivance: Farrell now deduces connection from tracks + stories (Ch 7)
- Updated Ch 10 to remove reference to left journal page

### Previous changes:
- Removed hired hand / Thomas Carver (two graves, not three)
- Added land-friction passages:
  - Ch 4: Storm night, frostbite, talking to horse
  - Ch 5: Six-day journey, wrong creek, ice crossing, coyotes
  - Ch 6: Ice sounds at homestead
  - Ch 8: Horse exhaustion, cottonwood bark, failed hunt
  - Ch 9: Soundscape ("silence was not silent")

### Key continuity points:
- Farrell: alcoholic, Mexican War veteran (Chapultepec), Scots-Irish PA background
- Morrow: also Mexican War veteran (Buena Vista, Mississippi Rifles implied), Virginia
- Both shaped by war, both hollowed out, different responses to emptiness
- Hardins: George and Catherine, married summer 1855, killed August 1858, buried behind barn
- Hardins childless after nearly three years of marriage (implied difficulty/grief)
- White buffalo: female, followed by Morrow since calf (April 1856)
- Lakota at end: Brulé band, leading white buffalo to Black Hills

### Timeline (see planning/timeline-geography.md for full detail):
- Hardins: married summer 1855, arrive early 1856, two winters, killed August 1858
- Journal entries: April 1856 → undated final entry (November 1858)
- Farrell's journey: November 1858 → January 1859
- Final chapter: same day as Morrow's death, Lakota perspective

### Voice consistency:
- Farrell: plain, direct, increasingly fragmented in Part Four
- Morrow: formal, biblical cadence, grows calmer toward end
- Chapter 12: third person, distant, observational, no interiority

### Ambiguities (intentional):
- Lakota at end: real or hallucination? (left open)
- Farrell's survival: unclear (fragments of rescue, then silence)
- Whether Farrell ever returns to Aldridge

### How Farrell connects Morrow to murders:
- Hears stories about "man who follows white buffalo" from multiple sources
- Trader mentions seeing him "four months back" (August 1858)
- At homestead, finds buffalo tracks AND human tracks leading away from graves
- Deduces: buffalo at homestead + man following buffalo + violence + timing = connection
- Confirmed when he reads full journal in Ch 10
