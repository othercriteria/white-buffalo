# Continuity Notes

## Current State (after Part Four, Chapter 9)

### Word count: ~26,000 words

### What's been written:
- Part One: Ch 1-3, JE I-II (Aldridge commissions Farrell, journey begins)
- Part Two: Ch 4-6, JE III-V (Platte corridor, trading post, finds empty homestead)
- Part Three: Ch 7-8, JE VI-VII (Investigation, graves, torn page, tracking north)
- Part Four: Ch 9, JE VIII (DTs peak, recognition of kinship with Morrow)

### What remains:
- Journal Entry IX: Morrow's final entry (early winter 1858, the morning of his death)
- Chapter 10: Farrell finds the camp, finds the journal, reads it
- Chapter 11: Farrell finds Morrow's body, sees the white buffalo, sees Lakota
- Chapter 12: Third-person frame - Lakota leading the white buffalo away

### Key points to maintain:
- Farrell is deep in DTs, unreliable narrator
- Journal entries are converging to present time
- Farrell has just seen Morrow in the distance
- The connection through Mexico (both men shaped by the war)
- Morrow's death must feel earned - he got what he sought
- Lakota reality: ambiguous (could be real, could be hallucination)
- Farrell's survival: ambiguous

### Timeline alignment:
- Journal entries: April 1856 → November 1858 (I-VIII)
- Farrell's journey: November 1858 → early February 1859
- Final journal entry will be dated just before Morrow's death

### Voice reminders:
- Farrell: plain, direct, increasingly fragmented
- Morrow: formal, biblical cadence, calm toward the end
- Final chapter: third person, distant, observational
