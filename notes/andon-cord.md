# Andon Cord Stops

Soft budget: ~10 blocking stops across the project.

**When to pull the cord:**
- Structural problem discovered (outline doesn't work as written)
- Voice/tone feels fundamentally wrong and I can't self-correct
- Major interpretive choice that could take the work in different directions
- End of a Part (natural checkpoint, may not always need)
- Before writing Part Five (the ending matters enough to verify approach)

**When NOT to pull:**
- Micro-level style questions (use questions-for-human.md)
- Normal drafting uncertainty (push through, revise later)
- Things I can verify against existing planning docs

## Log

| # | Point | Reason | Status |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | After Part One | Verify voice, tone, opening frame working | RESOLVED |

## Reserved checkpoints (tentative)

1. After Part One complete - verify voice, tone, opening frame working
2. After Part Two or Three - mid-manuscript check
3. Before Part Five - verify approach to ending
4. After complete first draft - before revision phase

Remaining ~6 stops: held for unexpected issues.
