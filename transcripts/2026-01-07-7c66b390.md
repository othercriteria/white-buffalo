# Book Club Discussion Questions for *White Buffalo*

## On Character and Motivation

1. **Farrell and Josiah Morrow are both Mexican War veterans who describe themselves as having been "hollowed out" by the violence they experienced. How does each man cope with this emptiness differently? What does this suggest about trauma and the choices available to those who carry it?**

2. **Ephraim Aldridge hires Farrell specifically so that he "would not have to" think too closely about what might happen to his daughter's killer. How does the novel explore the moral distance between commissioning violence and committing it?**

3. **Morrow writes that he felt "nothing" when killing the Hardins, yet he buries them carefully and leaves a journal page as confession. How do you reconcile these two responses? What does this suggest about his psychology?**

4. **Why does Farrell choose not to shoot the white buffalo when he has the chance? What has changed in him over the course of his journey?**

5. **Catherine Hardin appears both in her unfinished letter ("We are building something, Father. Something that will last.") and as a vision to Farrell. How does her presence—and absence—shape both narratives?**

## On Structure and Form

6. **The novel alternates between Farrell's third-person chapters and Morrow's first-person journal entries. How does this dual structure affect your understanding of and sympathy toward each character? Does one perspective feel more trustworthy than the other?**

7. **We learn about the Hardins' murder before Farrell does, through Morrow's journal entries. How does this dramatic irony affect your experience of Farrell's investigation?**

8. **The white buffalo never "speaks" in the novel—she is observed only from outside. Why do you think the author chose not to give her a perspective? What does she represent to different characters?**

## On Theme

9. **Morrow believes his death must be "sacred" to have meaning—that only something sacred can unmake what he has become. Is his logic sound? Does his death achieve what he hoped?**

10. **Both Farrell's alcoholism and Morrow's obsession with the white buffalo can be read as forms of self-destruction. How does the novel distinguish between these two paths?**

11. **The novel is set against the backdrop of "Bleeding Kansas" and the approaching Civil War. How does this historical context inform the characters' sense that violence is both inevitable and meaningless?**

12. **Farrell notes that he and Morrow "were two men formed from the same clay, fired in the same kiln. The difference was the way we chose to break." Do you agree with this assessment? What actually distinguishes these men?**

13. **The Lakota riders take the white buffalo to "sacred places" at the end. What does their brief appearance suggest about who has the right to claim or interpret sacred things?**

## On Setting and History

14. **The novel depicts the Great Plains as both beautiful and deadly, a place that "did not care whether I found what I was looking for or not." How does the landscape function as a character in the story?**

15. **Several characters mention that they expect a great war is coming. How does this foreknowledge of violence affect the way characters understand their own violent pasts?**

16. **The novel includes detailed descriptions of frontier survival—building fires, rationing supplies, reading animal tracks. How does this attention to material reality affect the story's treatment of its more mystical elements?**

## On Resolution and Meaning

17. **The final chapter shifts perspective to the Lakota riders. Why do you think the author chose to end the novel this way? What does this perspective add?**

18. **Farrell survives but tells us "that is another story, and it does not belong here." Why end with ambiguity rather than resolution? What kind of future might await him?**

19. **Morrow apologizes in his final journal entry for killing the Hardins but says he is "not sorry" for seeking his sacred death. Is the novel asking us to accept this distinction?**

20. **The book's final image is of the white buffalo walking "into the darkness" and being "gone." What do you make of this ending? Is it hopeful, mournful, or something else?**

# Teaching Materials: *White Buffalo*
## High School Literature Unit (Grades 10-12)

### Unit Overview

**Duration:** 3-4 weeks (depending on reading pace)

**Essential Questions:**
- How do individuals process trauma, and what are the consequences when that processing fails?
- What makes violence meaningful or meaningless?
- How do we judge characters whose actions horrify us but whose pain we understand?
- What role does the natural/sacred world play in human attempts to find redemption?

**Standards Alignment:** This unit addresses Common Core standards for literary analysis (RL.11-12.1-6), including analysis of complex characters, narrative structure, author's choices, and thematic development.

---

### Pre-Reading Activities

**1. Historical Context Introduction**

Provide students with brief background on:
- The Mexican-American War (1846-1848) and its veterans
- Westward expansion and homesteading in the 1850s
- "Bleeding Kansas" and the lead-up to the Civil War
- Lakota spiritual beliefs regarding the white buffalo (Ptesáŋwiŋ / White Buffalo Calf Woman)

**Discussion prompt:** "What happens to soldiers when a war ends? Where do they go, and what do they carry with them?"

**2. Vocabulary Preview**

Key terms to introduce:
- Homestead / homesteader
- Territory (as legal status)
- Sutler
- Daguerreotype
- Sod house
- Delirium tremens (withdrawal symptoms)
- Sacred vs. profane

**3. Genre Expectations**

Discuss the Western genre and its conventions. Ask students what they expect from a story set in the American frontier. After reading, return to these expectations and discuss how the novel fulfills or subverts them.

---

### During Reading

**Reading Schedule with Focus Questions:**

| Section | Chapters | Focus Questions |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Week 1 | Ch. 1, Journal I, Ch. 2, Journal II | What do we learn about Aldridge's assumptions? What does Morrow want, and why? |
| Week 2 | Ch. 3-4, Journals III-IV | How is the frontier depicted? What do the stories about the white buffalo suggest? |
| Week 3 | Ch. 5-7, Journals V-VII | What do we learn before Farrell does? How does Morrow justify murder? |
| Week 4 | Ch. 8-12, Journals VIII-IX | How do the two men's stories converge? What does the ending mean? |

**Annotation Practice:**

Have students track:
- Descriptions of the white buffalo (what language is used?)
- References to the Mexican War and its effects
- Moments when characters describe feeling "nothing" or "empty"
- The progression of Farrell's withdrawal symptoms

---

### Literary Analysis Topics

**1. Dual Narrative Structure**

*Learning Objective:* Analyze how authors use structure to create meaning.

Assign students to chart the timeline of both narratives. Note that Morrow's journal entries from 1856-1858 overlap with and precede Farrell's journey.

**Essay prompt:** "How does the novel's dual structure create dramatic irony? Choose one scene where the reader knows more than Farrell and analyze its effect."

**2. Character Study: The Unreliable Narrator**

*Learning Objective:* Evaluate narrator reliability and perspective.

Morrow's journal is our only access to his interiority. Examine entries where he describes feeling "nothing" followed by actions that suggest otherwise.

**Discussion:** "Can we trust Morrow's self-assessment? What evidence suggests he may be more—or less—self-aware than he claims?"

**3. Symbolism: The White Buffalo**

*Learning Objective:* Interpret symbols and their multiple meanings.

The white buffalo means different things to different characters:
- To Morrow: an instrument of sacred death
- To the Lakota: a sacred being with its own purposes
- To the homesteaders: nothing (they don't see her)
- To Farrell: something he chooses not to destroy

**Group activity:** Assign each group a character's perspective. Present your interpretation of what the buffalo symbolizes.

**4. Setting as Character**

*Learning Objective:* Analyze how setting contributes to theme.

The Great Plains are described as indifferent, deadly, and beautiful. Collect passages that personify the landscape.

**Writing prompt:** "The country did not care whether I found what I was looking for or not." In 2-3 paragraphs, analyze how the novel uses setting to develop its themes about human insignificance and/or meaning.

---

### Discussion Seminars

**Seminar 1: The Ethics of Violence (after Chapter 7)**

*Central text:* Morrow's Journal Entry VII, where he decides the homesteaders "must be removed."

*Questions:*
- How does Morrow rationalize murder?
- Is his reasoning coherent? Is it insane?
- Does understanding a killer's logic create sympathy?

**Seminar 2: Recognition and Judgment (after Chapter 11)**

*Central text:* Farrell's realization that he and Morrow are "formed from the same clay."

*Questions:*
- What does Farrell mean by this?
- Does recognition excuse, explain, or neither?
- How do we judge someone whose suffering we understand?

---

### Writing Assignments

**1. Analytical Essay (5-7 paragraphs)**

Choose one of the following prompts:

a) "Analyze how the novel uses physical journeys to represent psychological transformation. Focus on either Farrell or Morrow."

b) "The novel presents two veterans of the same war who respond to trauma in opposite ways. Compare their responses and evaluate what the novel suggests about the possibilities for healing."

c) "Examine the role of addiction in the novel. How does Farrell's alcoholism parallel or contrast with Morrow's obsession?"

**2. Creative Extension**

Write an additional journal entry from Morrow's perspective—either from before the novel begins (his time immediately after the war) or an impossible entry from after his death.

*Or:*

Write the letter Catherine Hardin never finished. What was she trying to tell her father?

**3. Comparative Analysis**

Compare *White Buffalo* to another text dealing with trauma and violence (options: *The Things They Carried*, *Blood Meridian*, *Beloved*, *A Farewell to Arms*).

---

### Assessment Rubric for Essays

## USER

This is helpful. I think many points we worked on seem to have landed as intended.

In your full transcript (but not the questions), you mention a timeline inconsistency. We had to do some surgery during revision, and this suggests we did an imperfect job. Describe the issue in detail. How might we fix it?

The first book club quetion points to both characters using the phrasing "hollowed out". If so, that might muddle things unless we want to do this meaningfully. What might we do here?

Do any of the other questions or classroom materials point to things we might change/fix/improve?

---

## ASSISTANT

Good questions. Let me dig into each.

## The Timeline Issue

I was initially confused, but on closer examination, I think the timeline is **internally consistent** but **insufficiently signposted for the reader**.

Here's what the dates tell us:

**Morrow's timeline (explicit):**
- April 1856: First sees the white buffalo calf
- June 1857: First notices the Hardins' homestead  
- August 1858: Kills them (Journal VII ends August 3 with "I cannot wait any longer")
- November 21, 1858 (approximately): Dies

**Farrell's timeline (implicit):**
- November [1858]: Hired by Aldridge
- December [1858]: Reaches the homestead, finds graves
- Late December 1858 / January 1859: Finds Morrow's body

The problem is that **no year is ever stated in Farrell's chapters**. A reader naturally assumes Farrell sets out soon after Catherine's letters stop (March 1856), which would make it impossible for him to find her already dead and buried.

The text actually supports a late-1858 departure: Aldridge says Catherine married "two years ago" and that he has "made inquiries" and "written to every authority." A 2.5-year delay is plausible for a methodical businessman exhausting official channels. But this isn't made clear.

**However, there is a genuine inconsistency in Chapter 5.** The trader says two contradictory things about the Hardins:

> "They came in once, early on, for supplies."

and

> "Haven't seen either one since last summer."

If they only came **once, early on** (1856), the trader can't have seen them "last summer" (1858). If "last summer" is correct, they came more than once.

**Suggested fixes:**

1. **Add a year marker early in Farrell's narrative.** In Chapter 1 or 2, have Farrell note the date explicitly, or have Aldridge say something like "It has been two and a half years since her last letter." This anchors the reader.

2. **Fix the trader's dialogue.** Change "They came in once, early on" to "They came through a few times" or simply cut "once"—this allows "last summer" to refer to a visit in early summer 1858, shortly before they were killed.

3. **Consider whether Aldridge's delay needs justification.** A brief line about his hopes that Catherine was simply unable to write, or his difficulty finding someone willing to take the job, might help.

---

## The "Hollowed Out" Phrasing

I checked the text. Both characters do use "hollow" language, but not identically:

**Morrow (Journal III):**
> "I was empty inside, hollow, a shell in the shape of a man."

**Farrell (Chapter 9):**
> "Something had hollowed him out, as the war had hollowed me."

This echo is actually **well-placed**—it occurs at the precise moment Farrell recognizes his kinship with Morrow. The shared vocabulary reinforces his insight that they were "formed from the same clay."

**Options:**

1. **Keep it as is.** The echo is meaningful, not accidental. Farrell's version ("hollowed out") is active and retrospective; Morrow's ("hollow") is static and present-tense. They're similar but distinct.

2. **Strengthen the intentionality.** If you want to make the echo unmistakably deliberate, you could have Farrell explicitly recognize the word: "He had written that he was *hollow*—and I knew that word, had felt its shape inside me."

3. **Differentiate further.** If you want more distinct voices, change Morrow's phrasing in Journal III to avoid "hollow" entirely: "I was empty inside, a shell, a mechanism." This preserves the meaning while giving Farrell sole claim to the specific word.

I'd lean toward option 1—the current version works, and the echo at the moment of recognition is effective.

---

## Other Potential Issues Surfaced by the Materials

### 1. The Hardins' First Winter

In Journal VI (dated September 1857), Morrow writes:

> "They have been here since early summer. I remember first seeing them then..."

But we know from Catherine's letters that she and George went west "two years ago" (from Aldridge's perspective in late 1858, so ~1856) and her last letter was March 1856. The Hardins should have been on the land for over a year when Morrow first notices them in June 1857.

This is fine—Morrow simply didn't notice them earlier, and he's isolated in a different part of the territory. But in the same journal entry, he says:

> "The first winter is the hardest, they say, and they have survived it."

If the Hardins arrived in 1855 or early 1856, by September 1857 they've survived *two* winters, not one. 

**Fix:** Change to "They have survived their winters" or "They have survived out here" to avoid the implication that they're new.

### 2. Aldridge's Disappearance

Aldridge is vividly present in Chapter 1, then vanishes. Farrell occasionally thinks of him ("I could return to Aldridge..."), but we never see the promised return. The novel ends with Farrell collapsed in the snow, and even when he wakes, he says "that is another story."

This is almost certainly intentional—the story is about the pursuit, not the resolution—but my book club questions prompted me to notice it. Some readers will want to know: Did Farrell return? What did Aldridge learn?

**Options:**
- Keep the ambiguity (current choice)
- Add a brief epilogue/coda from Aldridge's perspective
- Have Farrell's final thoughts include a brief intention: "Aldridge would have his answer, if I lived to give it."

### 3. The Shift to Lakota Perspective in Chapter 12

The novel is carefully told from white perspectives throughout—Farrell's close third person, Morrow's journals. Then Chapter 12 shifts to Wears His Horses Out and the Lakota riders.

This is striking and potentially powerful, but it's also a risk. The Lakota appear briefly, with limited interiority, primarily as witnesses and custodians of the sacred. Some readers may find this appropriative; others may find it a fitting widening of scope.

I don't have a strong prescription here—just flagging that it's a choice readers will notice. If you want to mitigate concerns, you might:
- Reduce the interiority (keep it more external/observational)
- Increase the interiority (give Wears His Horses Out more substantial perspective)
- Cut the Lakota perspective and end with Farrell's collapse, letting the buffalo's departure be seen through his fading consciousness

### 4. The Journal Page as Evidence

In Chapter 7, Farrell finds a bloodstained journal page at the graves with fragments visible: "*...the white buffalo... ...necessary... ...I am sorry for...*"

This is effective, but I wondered: when does Morrow tear out and leave this page? The journal entries don't mention doing this. In Chapter 10, Farrell reads that Morrow "left a page from his journal as a marker or a confession"—but this is Farrell's interpretation, not something in the journal itself.

**Minor fix option:** Add a brief line to Journal VII, after the murder: "I have left a page at the grave. I do not know if anyone will find it, or understand."

### 5. The Question of Farrell's Withdrawal

My teaching materials note the progression of Farrell's withdrawal symptoms. The novel handles this well—the tremors, sweating, visions, convulsions. But it's worth verifying the medical accuracy. The timeline suggests Farrell runs out of whiskey around the time he reaches the homestead (Chapter 6/7) and experiences peak withdrawal symptoms over the following week (Chapters 8-9), which aligns with the typical 3-7 day timeline for delirium tremens.

One potential issue: Farrell survives severe withdrawal (including convulsions and hallucinations) without medical intervention, in freezing conditions, while riding and tracking. This is not impossible, but it's at the edge of plausibility. The novel doesn't call attention to how unlikely his survival is, which might be appropriate (he's a survivor; that's established) or might undercut the realism you've built.

---

## Summary of Suggested Fixes

| Issue | Location | Suggested Fix |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Timeline unclear | Ch. 1 or 2 | Add explicit year (e.g., "November of 1858" or "two and a half years since her last letter") |
| Trader's inconsistency | Ch. 5 | Change "once, early on" to "a few times" |
| Hardins' winters | Journal VI | Change "first winter" to "winters" (plural) |
| Journal page placement | Journal VII | Optional: add line about leaving the page |
| "Hollow" echo | N/A | Keep as is—the echo is well-timed |

---

## USER

Re: timeline, the intent is that Aldridge is not being deceptive and is not dragging his feet, with the delay between the last letter and hiring Farrell being a few months of inquiries. He was primed to act quickly given his opinions about his son-in-law. It is probably worthwhile to explicitly build out the Hardins (and Aldridge's) timeline in the planning/ and/or notes/ docs in the same way we have done for Farrell and Morrow. I am not committed to the Hardins surviving two winters versus one winter (although I'd slightly prefer two) but the choice should be subordinate to the needs of the Farrell and Morrow timelines. Trader (and other) statements should obviously follow whatever we choose.

The journal page is a smoothed-over contrivance. Intentional placement seems better than accidental loss of a page. The core question is whether finding the page is necessary to confirm Farrell's knowledge of the involvement of Morrow and to motivate his continued pursuit. If not, we might eliminate this inelegant clue/breadcrumb or replace it with something else.

I'm happy keeping the "hollow" echo as-is.

Now I have the full picture. The planning doc has a timeline that doesn't quite match the text. Let me lay out the issues and options clearly.

---

## The Core Timeline Problem

The planning doc says the Hardins establish their homestead in **Spring 1857**. But Journal Entry VI (dated September 1857) has Morrow observe that "the first winter is the hardest, they say, and **they have survived it**."

If they arrived Spring 1857, they haven't had a winter yet by September 1857. Winter 1857-58 is still ahead.

For that line to be true, the Hardins must have arrived **before** winter 1856-57—which means late 1856 at the latest.

---

## Two Coherent Timeline Options

### Option A: One Full Winter (Simpler)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Late 1856** | Catherine and George marry |
| **Nov-Dec 1856** | Depart for Nebraska Territory |
| **Early 1857** | Arrive at homestead site; begin building |
| **Spring-Summer 1857** | Continue establishment; Catherine writes hopeful letters |
| **June 1857** | Morrow first notices homestead |
| **Sept 1857** | *[Journal VI]* Morrow observes they have "survived" their first months (NOT a full winter yet) |
| **Winter 1857-58** | Their first full winter |
| **March 1858** | Catherine's last letter ("winter is finally breaking") |
| **April-October 1858** | Aldridge's inquiries |
| **August 1858** | Morrow kills both Hardins |
| **November 1858** | Aldridge hires Farrell ("two years ago" = late 1856 marriage ✓) |

**Problem:** Journal VI says they survived "the first winter"—but under this timeline, that winter hasn't happened yet in September 1857.

**Fix required:** Change Journal VI text. Instead of "The first winter is the hardest, they say, and they have survived it," something like:
- "The first winter is the hardest, they say. We will see if they survive it."
- Or delete the line entirely.

---

### Option B: Two Full Winters (Your Preference)

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Summer 1855** | Catherine and George marry |
| **Fall 1855** | Depart for Nebraska Territory |
| **Early 1856** | Arrive at homestead site; begin building |
| **Spring-Summer 1856** | Establish homestead; Catherine's early hopeful letters |
| **Winter 1856-57** | First full winter (survive) |
| **Spring-Summer 1857** | Second year on the land; letters continue |
| **June 1857** | Morrow first notices homestead |
| **Sept 1857** | *[Journal VI]* Morrow observes "they have survived it" ✓ |
| **Winter 1857-58** | Second full winter |
| **March 1858** | Catherine's last letter |
| **April-October 1858** | Aldridge's inquiries |
| **August 1858** | Morrow kills both Hardins |
| **November 1858** | Aldridge hires Farrell |

**Problem:** "Two years ago" in Chapter 1 would be late 1856, but marriage was summer 1855 (over three years). 

**Fix required:** Change Chapter 1. Instead of "two years ago," use:
- "three years ago" 
- "nearly three years now"
- Or vaguer: "She married a man named George Hardin and went west against my wishes"

---

## My Recommendation

**Option B (two winters)** is slightly richer narratively:
- The Hardins are more established, making their deaths more tragic
- Catherine's letters have more time to show the arc from hope to guardedness
- The Journal VI line works as-is

The cost is one small change in Chapter 1—replace "two years ago" with "nearly three years ago" or similar.

---

## The Journal Page Question

You're right to flag this as a contrivance. Let me think through whether it's necessary.

### What the page currently provides:
- Fragments: "*...the white buffalo... ...necessary... ...I am sorry for...*"
- Farrell's deduction: "The man who followed the white buffalo... He had been here. He had done this."

### What Farrell would have WITHOUT the page:
- Two graves with careful burial (someone took time, felt something)
- Evidence of violence inside the house
- Buffalo tracks leading away from the homestead
- Human tracks following the buffalo tracks
- His memory of multiple stories about "the man who follows the white buffalo"
- The trader's comment that he saw the man "maybe four months back"—which matches the timing

### Could Farrell make the connection without explicit written evidence?

Yes. The reasoning would be:

*Buffalo don't come to homesteads. Someone buried these people carefully—took days to do it right. And there are tracks: a buffalo heading north, a man following behind. I've heard about that man from the trader, from the mail carrier, from the trapper at Fort Kearny. They all said the same thing: a man who follows a white buffalo, with nothing in his eyes.*

*He was here. He did this.*

This is actually **stronger** dramatically—Farrell is piecing it together from evidence and intuition, not finding a convenient clue. It also removes the awkwardness of Morrow leaving a confession at the scene (which seems out of character for someone who describes feeling "nothing" about the killing).

### Suggested approach:

**Remove the journal page entirely.** Instead:

1. **Chapter 7:** Keep the search of the homestead and discovery of the graves. Expand the tracks: Farrell finds buffalo tracks near the homestead (unusual) and human tracks following them north (very unusual). He makes the connection through reasoning.

2. **Chapter 7:** Add a moment of realization:
   > *I stood at the edge of the graves and looked north, at the tracks disappearing into the white. A buffalo had been here. And a man had followed it, as men had told me a man followed a white buffalo across this country.*
   > 
   > *I did not know why he had killed them. I did not know if there was a reason that would make sense to anyone but him. But I knew he had done it, and I knew where he had gone.*

3. **Chapter 10:** When Farrell finds and reads the full journal, he gets the complete story—including Morrow's reasoning about the Hardins being "in the way." This is where the reader (and Farrell) learn the why.

This removes the contrivance and makes Farrell's pursuit feel more like tracking than following a breadcrumb trail.

## Summary of Proposed Changes

### Planning Document Updates
- Create Hardins/Aldridge timeline in `planning/timeline-geography.md`
- Update continuity notes

### Text Edits

| Location | Current | Change to |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Ch. 1:91 | "two years ago" | "nearly three years ago" (if Option B) |
| Ch. 5:63-64 | "They came in once, early on" | "They came through a few times" |
| Ch. 7:57-85 | Journal page discovery scene | Remove; replace with Farrell observing tracks and reasoning to the connection |
| Journal VI | "The first winter is the hardest, they say, and they have survived it" | Keep as-is (Option B) or change to future tense (Option A) |

Want me to draft the specific text edits and the updated planning document?

## USER

Let's make both of your suggested changes (Option B, removing the journal page).

Adding a year of marriage for the Hardins does re-surface an issue that came up early in drafting (in which Catherine was pregnant, but it seemed excessively grim to have the death of a pregnant Catherine or of a young child). The couple having fertility issues might add some color to Catherine's letters, Aldridge's feelings about the marriage, and reduce some of the surprise around the homesteaders being childless?

---

## ASSISTANT

Good thinking on the fertility issue. It solves the childlessness question elegantly, adds emotional texture to Catherine's letters and Aldridge's grief, and avoids the grimness of a dead child. Let me implement all of this.

## Summary of Changes

### Timeline (Option B: Two Winters)

**planning/timeline-geography.md** — Added complete Hardins/Aldridge timeline:
- Hardins marry summer 1855, arrive early 1856
- Survive winters 1856-57 and 1857-58
- Killed August 1858
- Aldridge hires Farrell November 1858

### Childlessness Thread

**Chapter 1** (01-chapter-one.md):
- Changed "two years ago" → "nearly three years ago"
- Added Aldridge's concern about no grandchildren and what that silence means

**Chapter 2** (03-chapter-two.md):
- Farrell notices the absence of any mention of children in Catherine's letters

**Chapter 6** (11-chapter-six.md):
- At the homestead: "Two chairs. One bed. No cradle, no child's things..."

### Trader Fix

**Chapter 5** (09-chapter-five.md):
- Changed "They came in once, early on" → "They came through a few times, when they first settled"

### Journal Page Removal

**Chapter 7** (13-chapter-seven.md):
- Removed the journal page discovery scene entirely
- Replaced with Farrell finding buffalo tracks AND human tracks leading away from the graves
- He makes the connection through deduction: the stories he's heard + the timing + the tracks = the man who follows the white buffalo

**Chapter 10** (19-chapter-ten.md):
- Removed "left a page from his journal as a marker or a confession"
- Now reads "piling stones on the graves to keep the animals away"

### Documentation

**notes/continuity.md** — Updated to reflect all changes, including a new section explaining how Farrell connects Morrow to the murders without explicit evidence.

---

The journal page removal works well—Farrell's deduction from tracks and stories is actually more satisfying than finding a convenient clue. It shows him as the skilled tracker he's established to be, and it adds tension: he's following a hunch into the winter emptiness, not a paper trail.
