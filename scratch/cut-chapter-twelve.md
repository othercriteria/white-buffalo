# Chapter Twelve

The riders came down from the northern ridges in the gray light before dawn.

There were four of them—Lakota, from the Brulé band that wintered in the country near the Black Hills. They had been watching the white buffalo for months, following her at a distance, waiting for the strange white man who followed her to complete whatever business he had come here to do.

They had seen him approach her that morning. They had watched from the ridge as he walked across the meadow, shouting, waving his arms, doing everything he could to make her charge. They had seen her lower her head and run at him, and they had seen him stand his ground, not moving, not trying to escape, accepting the blow that came.

They had waited while the white man lay in the snow, motionless. They had waited while the white buffalo circled him, sniffing at his broken body, pawing at the ground beside him. They had waited until they were certain he was dead.

Then they had come down from the ridge.

The leader of the riders was a man named Wears His Horses Out, a warrior of middle years who had dreamed of the white buffalo since he was a boy. In his dream, she had come to him and spoken, though he could not remember afterward what she had said. He had spent his life waiting for her to appear in the waking world, and when word came that she had been seen on the northern plains, he had known what he must do.

He found her standing beside the body of the man who had followed her. She did not flee when he approached. She stood and watched as he dismounted and walked toward her, his hands empty, his voice low and steady.

*Ptesáŋwiŋ,* he said. *White Buffalo Woman. We have come to take you home.*

She looked at him with her dark eyes, and he thought he saw something in them—understanding, perhaps, or acceptance. Then she turned and began to walk, and he mounted his horse and followed.

---

They traveled north for three days, moving slowly, following the old paths that the people had used for generations. The white buffalo walked ahead of them, never hurrying, never lagging, setting a pace that seemed to belong to another world.

They did not speak of what they had seen in the valley. They did not need to. Each of them understood, in his own way, what the white man's death had meant. He had come seeking something sacred, and he had found it. He had paid the price that such seeking demanded.

It was not for them to judge. It was only for them to witness, and to carry the sacred thing home.

---

On the fourth day, they crossed the ridge that marked the edge of the sacred lands. The Black Hills rose before them, dark with pines, their peaks touched with snow. The white buffalo stopped at the crest of the ridge and looked back—toward the south, toward the valley where she had spent two years, toward the man who had followed her.

Then she turned and walked down into the hills, and the riders followed.

---

In the valley, the snow continued to fall.

It covered the body of Josiah Morrow, slowly, gently, the way it covered everything in this country. The blood on the ground disappeared beneath a blanket of white. The churned earth smoothed itself out. The evidence of violence faded until there was nothing left but the shape of a man, barely visible, sinking into the land.

A hundred yards away, another shape lay in the snow. This one was still breathing, its chest rising and falling in shallow rhythm, its face pale beneath a crust of ice. A horse stood nearby, its reins trailing in the snow, its breath steaming in the cold air.

The man did not move. He had been lying there for hours, since the white buffalo and her escorts had disappeared over the northern ridge. He had watched them go—if his eyes could be trusted, if anything he had seen that day could be trusted—and then he had let the cold take him.

He was not dead. Not yet. But he was close, closer than he had ever been, and the part of him that had wanted to die for so long was finally getting its wish.

The snow fell. The wind whispered across the meadow, carrying with it the smell of pine and ice and distances too great to measure. The sky was gray and low, pressing down on the world like a hand.

---

The riders did not look back.

They moved through the hills in single file, the white buffalo leading the way, picking a path that only she could see. The trees closed around them, the pines rising tall and dark, their branches heavy with snow. The light dimmed as they went deeper, and the sounds of the world—the wind, the creak of snow, the breathing of horses—faded into silence.

They traveled until the sun set, and then they made camp in a clearing where the old ones had made camp before them. They built no fire—they did not need one, not with the sacred one among them—and they sat in the darkness and watched her standing at the edge of the trees, looking up at the stars.

Wears His Horses Out thought about the white man they had left behind. The other one, the one who had followed the first but arrived too late. He had seen him in the valley, kneeling beside the body, his face a mask of confusion and exhaustion. He had seen him collapse in the snow, and he had thought about going to him, helping him, bringing him out of the cold.

But he had not. The white man's fate was his own. The sacred one had her own purposes, and those purposes did not include the salvation of lost souls.

He turned his face toward the hills, toward the sacred places, toward whatever waited beyond. The white buffalo stood in the starlight, her coat glowing faintly, her breath rising in clouds.

Tomorrow they would go deeper into the hills. Tomorrow they would find the place where she was meant to be.

Tonight, they waited.

---

The snow continued to fall in the valley. It covered the dead man completely, erasing him from the world. It covered the other man almost as completely, leaving only a dark shape against the white.

The horse stamped its feet and snorted. It waited for its rider to rise, to mount, to give it some direction. But the rider did not move.

The light faded. The stars came out, one by one, appearing through breaks in the clouds. The wind died, and the world grew still, and the valley held its silence like a secret it would never tell.

In the distance, the Black Hills waited.

And the white buffalo, sacred and wild and free, walked into the darkness and was gone.
