## 1. Chapter Four Insert: The Bad Night (before Fort Kearny)

*Placement: After "The first week passed without incident. The second began the same way." Replace with expansion.*

The first week passed without incident. The second did not.

On the ninth day the weather turned. I had been watching the sky all morning—the clouds thickening in the northwest, the light going flat and gray—and I knew what was coming before the first flakes fell. By noon the snow was falling hard, driven sideways by a wind that cut through my coat like it was paper.

I pushed on. The trail was still visible, and I had covered perhaps ten miles since morning, and I told myself I could make the shelter of the next creek bottom before the worst of it hit.

I was wrong.

By mid-afternoon the trail had disappeared under a blanket of white, and the wind had risen to a howl, and I could not see twenty feet in any direction. The horse balked, turning his head away from the driving snow, and I could feel the tremor in his muscles—not exhaustion yet, but the beginning of it, the body's protest against conditions it was not made to endure.

I dismounted and led him by the reins, one hand on his neck, feeling my way forward through the white. The cold was a living thing now, pressing against me from all sides, finding every gap in my clothing, every inch of exposed skin. My beard froze solid. The moisture in my breath turned to ice on my collar.

We walked for hours. I do not know how many. Time lost meaning in the white, and there was nothing to measure it by—no sun, no landmarks, no sense of progress. Just the snow and the wind and the slow accumulation of cold in my bones.

I found the creek by falling into it.

The ice was thin at the edge, hidden under the snow, and my boot went through before I could stop myself. The water was not deep—perhaps a foot—but it was cold enough to stop my heart, and I pulled myself out gasping, my leg soaked to the knee.

Wet is deadly. I knew that. I had seen men die from less—men who got their feet wet and could not get dry, whose flesh turned black and fell away in pieces. I had to find shelter. I had to build a fire.

The creek bottom offered some protection from the wind. The banks rose on either side, and there were willows here, bare but thick enough to break the worst of the gusts. I led the horse into a hollow where a fallen cottonwood had made a kind of natural windbreak, and I got to work.

My hands were shaking too badly to strike a match. It took me five tries, six, seven, before one finally caught, and by then the shaking had spread to my whole body. I fed the flame with dead grass, then twigs, then larger branches, coaxing it to life with the desperation of a man who knows his life depends on it.

The horse stood with his back to the wind, head down, snow crusting on his mane. He was shivering too—short bursts, then longer ones, the muscles of his flanks rippling under his coat. I had no blanket for him, nothing to offer except the hope that the fire would warm us both.

I stripped off my boot and my sock and held my foot as close to the flames as I could bear. The skin was white, waxy, and I could not feel my toes. I rubbed them with my hands, forcing the blood back into the flesh, and gradually the feeling returned—pain at first, sharp and terrible, then a dull ache that was almost worse.

I did not sleep that night. I fed the fire and rubbed my foot and talked to the horse, telling him things I had never told anyone, just to hear a human voice in the howling dark. He listened, or seemed to, his ears flicking toward me when I spoke, though he had no more answers than I did.

By morning the storm had passed. The sky was clear and pale, the sun coming up cold and distant over a world made new by snow. I saddled the horse and we went on, both of us slower than before, both of us marked by what the night had cost.

Fort Kearny was three days ahead. I made it in four.

## 2. Chapter Five Insert: The Journey to the Homestead

*Placement: Replace "On the second day, I found it." with expansion. This covers the six days from trading post to homestead.*

The first day out from the trading post, I made good time. The sky was clear, the wind light, and the river showed me the way north as clearly as any road. I counted the creeks as I passed them, as the trader had instructed, and I camped that night in a stand of pines on a south-facing slope where the snow was thin and the deadfall plentiful.

The second day, the country began to look the same.

The hills rolled on in every direction, white and gray and featureless, each one identical to the last. The creeks that fed the river came down from the north at irregular intervals, some wide and obvious, others little more than frozen trickles that might have been creeks or might have been nothing at all. I counted them as I had been counting, but I began to lose confidence in my count.

Had that been a creek, or just a fold in the land? Had I missed one earlier, passed it without noticing? The trader had said the Hardins' creek was the only one for ten miles, but how would I know? The country kept its secrets.

I saw antelope that day, a small herd moving across a distant ridge, their tan coats stark against the white. I thought about hunting them—my supplies were adequate but not generous—but they were too far, and I had neither the time nor the ammunition to waste on a chase that might lead nowhere.

That night I heard coyotes for the first time. They started after dark, a single voice rising from somewhere to the west, and then others answering—a chorus of yips and howls that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. The sound raised the hair on my neck. It was not threatening, exactly, but it was wild in a way that reminded me how far I was from anything I knew.

The horse did not like it either. He stamped and snorted, pulling at his tether, and I had to speak to him softly for a long time before he settled.

On the third day, I crossed a creek I thought was the one I was looking for, and followed it north for three hours before I realized my mistake. The valley narrowed to a dead end, the hills closing in on either side, and there was no homestead here, no sign that anyone had ever lived in this place.

I turned back. Three hours wasted, and the short winter day already half gone. I made camp early that night, in a hollow that offered little shelter, and I lay awake listening to the wind and thinking about how easy it would be to die out here. Not dramatically, not heroically, but simply—a wrong turn, a missed landmark, a night without fire, and in the morning nothing but a shape under the snow that no one would find until spring.

The fourth day I found the right creek.

I knew it as soon as I saw it—wider than the others, the valley opening out to the north, the willows along its banks brown and thick. I turned up it and felt something ease in my chest, some tension I had not known I was carrying.

But the country was not done with me yet.

The crossing looked easy enough—the ice was thick, the surface smooth, the far bank no more than twenty feet away. I started across without dismounting, the horse picking his way carefully, testing each step before committing his weight.

We were halfway across when the ice cracked.

It did not break—not entirely—but I heard it, a sound like a gunshot, and felt the surface shift beneath us. The horse lurched forward, panicking, his hooves scrabbling for purchase, and I threw myself from the saddle as the ice tilted and groaned.

I hit the far bank on my hands and knees, scrambling up the frozen mud, and turned to see the horse still on the ice, frozen with fear, his legs splayed wide. The surface was buckled now, water seeping up through the cracks, and I could see the dark of the creek beneath.

"Come on," I said. My voice was steadier than I felt. "Come on, boy. Easy now."

He would not move. His eyes were wide and white, his whole body trembling, and I knew that if he panicked again—if he tried to run—the ice would give way beneath him and he would go through.

I talked to him. I do not remember what I said, but I talked, keeping my voice low and steady, the way you talk to something that does not understand words but understands tone. Slowly, slowly, I moved back onto the ice, testing each step, feeling it flex beneath my weight.

I reached him and took the reins. I could feel his fear through the leather, the way his whole body was strung tight, ready to bolt. I stroked his neck and talked to him and began to lead him forward, one step at a time, toward the bank.

We made it. The ice held. But when we reached solid ground, my legs gave out beneath me and I sat in the snow for a long time, shaking, while the horse stood beside me and steamed in the cold air.

That night I built a fire larger than I needed and sat close to it, feeling the warmth on my face, listening to the ice on the creek settle and crack in the darkness. I was close now. The homestead was a day's ride, maybe less.

But the country had reminded me what it could do. The country did not care whether I found what I was looking for or not.

On the sixth day, I found the homestead.

## 3. Chapter Eight Insert: The Horse Gives Out

*Placement: In Chapter 8, after he finds the trail again on day 5. Before "The visions came back that night, worse than before."*

The horse was failing.

I had not wanted to see it, but by the afternoon of the fifth day I could no longer pretend otherwise. He was moving slowly, his head low, his steps heavy and uncertain. The deep snow was taking its toll—every step an effort, every yard a battle against the white that seemed to grip at his legs and hold him back.

I dismounted and led him for a while, breaking trail with my own body, but I was not much stronger than he was. The shaking in my hands had spread to my legs, and the world kept going gray at the edges, and sometimes I forgot what I was doing and stood there in the snow until the cold reminded me to move.

We stopped in a draw where the snow was shallower and the wind less fierce. The horse stood with his head down, breathing hard, his flanks dark with sweat despite the cold. I knew what that meant. A sweaty horse in winter is a dying horse, if you cannot get him dry.

I had no blanket for him. I had barely enough for myself. But I found a stand of cottonwood and stripped bark from the branches—sweet cottonwood, I hoped, though I could not be sure until he tried it—and I piled it in front of him and waited.

He ate. Not eagerly, but he ate, his teeth scraping the bark from the wood, his jaw working slowly. I watched him and felt something like hope.

"We rest here," I told him. "One night. Maybe two. Until you can go on."

He did not answer. But he kept eating, and that was answer enough.

I made camp. I built a fire from the cottonwood and the deadfall I could gather, and I melted snow for water, and I ate the last of my bacon and most of my coffee. My supplies were running out. I had been too long on this trail, too many days in the white, and I had not planned for this.

I thought about what I would do if the horse could not go on. I could walk—the tracks I was following were clear enough, and the man who made them was on foot himself—but how far could I walk in my condition? A day? Two? The shaking had not stopped, and the visions came even when I was awake now, and I was not certain I could trust my own eyes anymore.

The soldiers stood at the edge of the firelight, watching me. I did not look at them directly.

In the morning the horse was better. Not well—he would not be well until he had rest and food and shelter, none of which I could give him—but better. He ate more bark, and drank the water I melted for him, and when I saddled him he stood steady under my weight.

"One more day," I said. "Just one more. Then we'll find him, and this will be over."

I did not know what "over" meant. I did not let myself think about it.

We went on.

## 4. Scattered Texture: Coyotes, Ice, Food

*These are shorter passages to insert throughout Parts 2-3.*

### 4a. Coyotes (for Chapter 5, trading post night)

I slept badly that night in the trader's stable, wrapped in straw and my own blanket, listening to the coyotes call in the hills above the post. They started around midnight—a single voice, high and wavering, and then another, and then a dozen more, their cries overlapping and echoing until it sounded like the whole country was singing. It was not a threatening sound, but it was not a comforting one either. It was the sound of a world that did not know I existed, that would go on singing whether I lived or died.

### 4b. The Ice (for Chapter 6, at the homestead)

In the night I heard the ice on the creek behind the house. It made sounds I had not expected—groans and cracks and sometimes a noise like something heavy being dragged across a wooden floor. The creek was freezing deeper, the ice thickening, and each expansion and contraction sent vibrations through the ground that I could feel in my bones. The dead slept under that sound, I thought. The Hardins, buried behind their barn, listened to the ice every night, and would go on listening until spring came and the water ran free again.

### 4c. Failed Hunt (for Chapter 8, during tracking)

I tried to hunt on the third day. I saw a rabbit—just a flash of white against the snow, but I knew what it was—and I dismounted and loaded my rifle and stood there with the gun raised, waiting for it to move again.

My hands would not stop shaking. The barrel wavered, describing circles in the air, and even when I braced it against a tree I could not hold it steady. The rabbit moved, and I fired, and the shot went wide by a foot or more, and the rabbit vanished into the white as if it had never been.

I stood there for a long time, looking at the place where it had been, the smell of powder sharp in the cold air. I had perhaps two days of food left. The man I was following might have none.

We were alike in that too.

### 4d. What the Country Sounds Like (for Chapter 9, final approach)

The silence was not silent. I knew that now.

There was the wind, always the wind, hissing across the snow, finding every gap in my clothing, speaking in a voice that might have been words if I could only understand them. There was the crunch of hooves on the frozen surface, and the creak of leather, and the horse's breathing, heavy and labored. There was the blood in my own ears, loud as a drum.

And underneath it all, like a bass note too low to hear, there was the silence itself—the vast emptiness of the country pressing in from all sides, the weight of all that nothing bearing down on me until I felt I might be crushed by it.

The soldiers made no sound as they walked beside me. Catherine Hardin drifted through the white without leaving tracks. Only the living made noise in this country, and there were so few of us left.
