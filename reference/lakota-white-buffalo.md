## White Buffalo Calf Woman (Ptesáŋwiŋ)

**Who She Is:**
- Lakȟótiyapi: Ptesáŋwiŋ (White Buffalo Calf Woman) or White Buffalo Maiden
- "A supernatural entity of the Sioux, who serves as an intermediary between the people and the Great Spirit"
- "Central to the Lakota religion as the primary cultural prophet"
- Appeared during a time of famine, when people had "forgotten how to pray and had lost connection with the Great Spirit"

**The Legend:**
- 19 generations ago, during famine, a chief sent two scouts to hunt
- They encounter a beautiful maiden in the wilderness
- One scout is "lustful" and tries to lay hands on her — he is killed
- The other shows "proper respect" and is sent to tell his people she is coming
- She arrives and brings sacred gifts

**What She Brought:**
- The čhaŋnúŋpa — the sacred ceremonial pipe
- The Seven Sacred Rites

**The Seven Sacred Rites:**
1. Purifying body and spirit (sweat lodge)
2. The Sun Dance
3. The vision quest
4. Making of relatives
5. Throwing of the ball
6. Preparing a girl for womanhood
7. Keeping of the spirit

**Her Departure (key for the novel):**
- As she left, she stopped, lay down, and rolled over
- First became a black buffalo
- Then a red buffalo
- Then a yellow buckskin buffalo
- Finally, a white buffalo
- Then "walking out of sight"

## The Sacred White Buffalo

**Significance:**
- "The most sacred living thing on earth" to American Indians
- "A profoundly significant spiritual event"
- A sign of hope
- A reminder of the covenant between Lakota and buffalo nation
- "A sign to begin life's sacred loop"

**Rarity:**
- Extremely rare
- The birth of one is interpreted as a message
- Both blessing and warning

**Recent Context (2024):**
- A white buffalo calf born in Yellowstone (June 4, 2024)
- Lakota chief Arvol Looking Horse: "The birth of this calf is both a blessing and warning. We must do more."

## Lakota in the 1850s

**Territory:**
- Settled in Black Hills region around 1765
- Moved from Minnesota to western South Dakota, eastern Wyoming, eastern Montana
- Conquered Cheyenne in 1776, took Black Hills territory
- Black Hills = center of their culture

**Bands:**
- The Brulé (Sičháŋǧu) — one of the major bands
- "The Sicangu centered their territories around the White River, from its mouth to the margins of the Black Hills"
- Other bands include Oglala, Miniconjou, Hunkpapa, etc.

**1850s Context:**
- "The tribes were thriving and there were plenty of buffalo"
- But gold discovery bringing white settlers to the plains
- 1857: "Thousands of Sioux gathered in the Black Hills and vowed to protect their lands from the whites"
- Both whites and Indians recognized buffalo were disappearing already

**Lifestyle:**
- "Did not build permanent shelters but instead roamed their land"
- But population remained within identifiable domain
- Black Hills important for lodge poles, plant resources, small game

**Winter Patterns:**
- Would seek shelter in protected areas
- Black Hills provided resources and protection
- Moved seasonally following buffalo and resources

## The Sacred Pipe Today

- Kept by Arvol Looking Horse (b. 1954), 19th keeper
- Passed down through lineage for 19 generations
- Original pipe from White Buffalo Calf Woman still exists

## Application to the Novel

**What the Lakota Would See:**
- A white buffalo is sacred beyond measure
- They would approach with reverence
- They would want to take her to sacred places (Black Hills)
- A white man following her = strange, possibly blasphemous
- A white man killed by her = possibly fitting, possibly tragic

**Restraint for the Novel:**
- Don't over-explain
- Don't put modern spiritual language in their mouths
- Show their actions, not their theology
- The reverence should be evident in behavior
- Farrell wouldn't understand what he's seeing

**Language:**
- Ptesáŋwiŋ = White Buffalo Woman/Maiden (already used in draft)
- Sičháŋǧu = Brulé band
- Čhaŋnúŋpa = sacred pipe
- Wakan Tanka = Great Mystery / Great Spirit

**The Ending:**
- Lakota riders leading white buffalo away = returning sacred thing to sacred place
- They don't save Farrell = he's not their responsibility
- They don't acknowledge him = he's irrelevant to what matters
- The white buffalo going "into the darkness and was gone" = appropriate, mysterious
