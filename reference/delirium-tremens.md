# Delirium Tremens Reference

Research compiled for *White Buffalo* revision. Farrell is an alcoholic who runs out of whiskey mid-journey.

## Historical Context

**When DT Was Named:**
- Term "delirium tremens" coined in 1813 by Sutton
- But symptoms described since 1700s as "Brain fever"
- Pearson (1813) noted cause was "frequent and excessive alcohol intoxications"

**Period Understanding:**
- No concept of alcoholism as disease
- Seen as moral failing or weakness
- No treatment beyond letting it run its course (or not)

**Historical Mortality:**
- Without treatment: 15-35% death rate
- Many simply died during withdrawal
- No understanding of why some survived and others didn't

## Timeline of Symptoms

**6-24 hours after last drink:**
- Tremor appears first ("the shakes")
- Anxiety, restlessness
- Nausea, loss of appetite
- Sweating, rapid pulse

**12-48 hours:**
- Hallucinations may emerge (occurs in only ~0.5% of cases, but Farrell is a heavy drinker)
- Predominantly visual, then auditory, then tactile
- Seizures may occur

**48-72 hours:**
- Full delirium tremens develops
- This is the most severe stage
- "Often overcomes the patient by surprise, because a brief period of uneventful sobriety of 1-2 days tends to precede it"

**Duration:**
- Typically lasts 3-4 days
- Can extend to 8-10 days
- "Classically ends with a prolonged sleep"

## The Classical Triad

1. **Confusion state** - "Profound global confusion is the hallmark"
2. **Sensoperceptive disorders** - Hallucinations and vivid illusions
3. **Intense tremors** - Of tongue, eyelids, outstretched arms, whole body

## Symptoms in Detail

**Physical:**
- Tremor (hands, arms, tongue, eyelids)
- Heavy sweating (diaphoresis)
- Elevated heart rate (tachycardia)
- Elevated blood pressure
- Fever
- Nausea, vomiting
- Psychomotor hyperactivity (agitation)
- Autonomic hyperactivity (body systems in overdrive)
- Seizures possible

**Mental:**
- Clouding of consciousness
- Inattention
- Disorientation (to time, place, person)
- Motor agitation
- Alteration of sleep-wake cycle
- Disturbance in short-term memory
- Feelings of "impending doom"
- Anxiety, expecting imminent death

## Hallucinations

**Types:**
- Visual (most common)
- Auditory
- Tactile

**Visual Hallucinations:**
- Often involve animals: insects, snakes, rats
- "Lilliputian hallucination" — miniature animals, a classic feature
- Can be terrifying or benign
- Vivid and convincing to the sufferer

**Tactile Hallucinations:**
- "Formication" — sensation of insects crawling on or under skin
- Feeling of things touching, grabbing

**Auditory Hallucinations:**
- Voices, sounds
- Often threatening or accusatory

## Application to Farrell

**Timeline for the novel:**
- Farrell's whiskey runs out somewhere in Part Three
- By Part Four (Chapter 9), he's deep in DTs
- The soldier hallucinations fit the visual/Lilliputian pattern
- Catherine Hardin appearing = visual hallucination of person
- The confusion, disorientation, trembling all fit

**What He Would Experience:**
- The shakes starting within a day
- 1-2 days of increasing anxiety, nausea
- Then the hallucinations emerging, initially dismissable
- Growing certainty that what he sees is real
- Physical symptoms: sweating despite cold, racing heart, fever
- Impending doom — he thinks he's dying
- Time distortion
- Memory lapses

**What Makes It Worse:**
- Cold exposure
- Dehydration
- Lack of food
- Physical exertion
- No way to get more alcohol

**Period Language:**
- He wouldn't call it "delirium tremens"
- Might know "the horrors" or "the shakes"
- Might think he's going mad
- Might think he's being punished

## Useful for Revision

- The 1-2 day "uneventful sobriety" before full DT = why symptoms peak when they do
- The Lilliputian hallucinations = the dead soldiers could appear small or distorted
- Formication = he might feel things crawling on him
- The "impending doom" = he expects to die and may not care
- Physical symptoms in cold = sweating despite freezing, which would terrify him
- The prolonged sleep at the end = if he survives, he collapses into days of unconsciousness
