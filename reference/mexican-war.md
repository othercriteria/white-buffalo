Research compiled for *White Buffalo* revision. Both protagonists served in this war.

## Key Battles

### Buena Vista (February 22-23, 1847)

The central battle for both Farrell and Morrow. Key details:

**The Terrain:**
- Fought near Saltillo, in a narrow mountain pass
- "Deep and precipitous arroyos" forming barriers
- Steep hills, ravines, dense thickets
- Gullies channeled movement

**The Numbers:**
- ~4,650 Americans vs. ~15,000-20,000 Mexicans under Santa Anna
- Mexican army had marched three weeks through desert, many dying of exposure/starvation
- American casualties: ~750, including 267 killed
- Mexican dead: 500+ left on battlefield

**Sensory Details:**
- Mexican 8-pounder cannons "barked incessantly"
- American artillery replied with "a terrific barrage of grapeshot and canister"
- Infantrymen "fired virtually point-blank at the buttons on the blue overcoats"
- Mexican forces in "long tall hats, bedecked with tinsel & their blue overcoats streaming in the wind"
- "Long glittering muskets pointing directly at us"
- A "sudden rainstorm broke across the battlefield" as fighting concluded

**The Panic:**
- At one point Taylor's left and center swung back "like a huge door on a hinge"
- "A routed mob of soldiers was fleeing in panic"
- One witness: "The panic was contagious; men left the ranks in all the regiments, and soon our rear was a confused mass of fugitives"

**The Aftermath:**
- Lt. Lew Wallace visited days later: "the wrecks lay in awful significance—dead men and horses, bayonets, accoutrements, broken muskets, hats, caps, cartridge paper, fragments of clothing"
- "The earth and rocks were in places black with blood, here splotch, there a little rill"
- Large pit graves for both sides

### Mississippi Rifles at Buena Vista

Jefferson Davis's regiment—Morrow likely served with them or similar unit.

**Appearance:**
- "Red shirts, slouch hats, and white pants, with bowie knives thrust into their belts"
- Also described as "red flannel shirts, Panama hats, and white duck trousers"
- "Resplendent" but not frontiersmen—disciplined soldiers

**Weapons:**
- Model 1841 percussion rifles (the "Mississippi Rifle")
- More accurate and longer-ranged than standard smoothbore muskets
- Davis used Washington connections to secure these

**The V-Formation:**
- Davis's famous tactical innovation
- Mexican cavalry approached in "beautiful order"—"a body of richly caparisoned lancers came forward rapidly"
- "Files and ranks so closed, as to look like a solid mass of men and horses"
- Davis arranged men in V-formation
- "Perfect silence and the greatest steadiness prevailed in both lines of our troops as they stood at shouldered arms awaiting an attack"

**Casualties:**
- 1st Mississippi Rifles: 100 casualties from 300-man strength
- 47 killed
- Davis wounded in right heel—ball shattered bone, embedded brass spur fragments and wool fibers
- Spent two years on crutches

### Other Battles

**Monterrey (September 1846):**
- Urban combat, street fighting
- Breaking through barred doors to reach rooftops
- Engaging snipers
- Advancing between artillery discharges

**Resaca de la Palma (May 1846):**
- Fierce hand-to-hand combat
- Unfamiliar terrain for Mexican forces

**Cerro Gordo:**
- "Guns blazing all around"
- Charging "the enemy with their cannons thundering at you from a fortified hilltop"

## Daily Life and Conditions

**Rations:**
- "Our living is principally bread and beef. Coffee sugar rice or beans"
- Fell short of peacetime standards

**Pay:**
- Duty sergeant: thirteen dollars monthly
- Delays in pay common (soldiers owed months of back pay)

**Mortality:**
- Of ~90,000 Americans who served, ~13,000 died
- Only ~2,000 killed by enemy or died of battle wounds
- The majority died from disease or illness—7x more than combat deaths

**Uniforms:**
- M1833 Shell Jacket for enlisted infantry
- Powder horns made from cow horn
- Equipment often worn and inadequate

## Psychological Aftermath

**No Framework:**
- "Mid-nineteenth-century America lacked the scientific understanding that a traumatic experience, like warfare, could harm the mind"
- "They had no words to identify PTSD or shell shock"
- Consensus was that "only weak-willed soldiers or persons with underlying health conditions" suffered

**Period Term:**
- "Nostalgia" used for combat-related emotional disturbance
- Symptoms: missing home, feeling sad, sleep problems, anxiety
- Considered a form of homesickness, temporary or cowardly
- Physicians observed sadness, sleep disruption, anxiety

**Important:** Neither Morrow nor Farrell would have language for what's happening to them. "Nostalgia" at most.

## Useful for Revision

- The sensory overload of Buena Vista can inform flashbacks
- The "confusion" and "panic" match the psychological damage
- Davis's disciplined Mississippians standing in "perfect silence" = the emptiness Morrow describes
- The pit graves, blood-black earth, the smell—all available for memory fragments
- Disease killing more than combat = random, meaningless death
