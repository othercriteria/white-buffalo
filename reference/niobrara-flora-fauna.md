# Niobrara Region: Flora, Fauna, and Landscape

Research compiled for *White Buffalo* revision. The final portion of Farrell's journey and the ending take place in this region.

## Geography

**The River:**
- Niobrara River = tributary of Missouri, ~568 miles long
- Runs through Wyoming and Nebraska
- Called "Running Water" by Indians and early settlers

**The Valley:**
- Unlike other Great Plains rivers, the Niobrara is rapidly eroding
- Cuts down into ancient formations
- Confined to a narrow valley over much of its length
- High cliffs looming over portions
- At Valentine: valley nearly 300 feet deep and half mile wide

**Unique Features:**
- Waterfalls — "unique to both Nebraska and the Great Plains"
- Mix of north-facing slopes (shady, cool, wet) and south-facing slopes (sun-drenched)
- Six ecosystems converge along its banks

## Ecosystems Present

**1. Northern Boreal Forest** (north-facing slopes):
- Paper birch
- Aspen
- Ferns and club mosses
- Cooler microclimates from shade and groundwater

**2. Rocky Mountain Forest:**
- Ponderosa pine
- Serviceberry
- Horizontal juniper

**3. Eastern Deciduous Forest** (moist bottomlands and islands):
- American elm
- Basswood
- Cottonwood
- Green ash
- Bur oak
- Hackberry
- Box elder

**4-6. Three Types of Prairie:**
- Mixed grass prairie
- Tallgrass remnants
- Sandhills prairie

## Flora (Plants)

**Over 500 species documented. Notable:**
- Paper birch — at southern edge of range
- Ponderosa pine — at eastern edge of range
- Rare hybrid aspen (quaking x bigtooth)
- Cottonwood along waterways (sweet cottonwood for horse feed)
- Various grasses, sedges

**Winter-relevant:**
- Cottonwood bark for horses
- Dried grasses under snow for grazing
- Pine for shelter construction
- Deadfall for fuel

## Fauna (Animals)

**Large Mammals:**
- Bison (buffalo) — once abundant
- Elk — less common
- Mule deer — common
- White-tailed deer — common
- Pronghorn

**Predators:**
- Coyote — "haunting howls and yips" quintessential sound
- Swift fox
- Badger
- (Wolves present in 1850s, less so later)

**Small Mammals:**
- Beaver
- Mink
- River otter
- Prairie dogs — "prefer lands grazed by bison for their colonies"
- Rabbits

**Birds (200+ species):**

*Winter residents:*
- Snowy Owl
- Gyrfalcon
- Northern Shrike
- Common Redpoll
- Snow Bunting
- Winter finches (rosy-finches in western areas)

*Year-round:*
- Burrowing Owl
- Greater Prairie-Chicken
- Sharp-tailed Grouse
- Wild turkey
- Various hawks and eagles

*Spring migrants (late February onward):*
- Sandhill Cranes — "hundreds of thousands"
- Snow Geese — "millions"

**Reptiles:**
- Bull snakes (hibernating in winter)

## Soundscape

**Winter Sounds:**
- Coyote howls and yips — especially at dusk and dawn
- Wind across the prairie — constant, varying
- Snow crunching underfoot
- Ice cracking on river
- Occasional bird calls (sparse in deep winter)
- The silence — often the dominant "sound"

**Year-round:**
- Meadowlark's "plaintive song"
- Upland sandpiper's whistle
- Greater prairie-chicken's "booming"
- Coyote calls

## What Farrell Would Encounter in Winter

**Visual:**
- High cliffs over river
- Ponderosa pines on slopes, dark against snow
- Cottonwoods along waterways, bare
- Vast grassland under snow
- Buffalo in distance (if lucky)
- Deer, pronghorn
- Possibly elk

**Auditory:**
- Wind — ever-present
- Coyotes at night
- His horse's breath, hooves on snow/ice
- Silence pressing in
- Ice on the river cracking/groaning
- Sparse bird calls

**What He'd Eat (if hunting):**
- Deer — most likely
- Rabbit — common
- Wild turkey — possible
- Buffalo — if he could find and kill one
- Small game (squirrel, etc.)

**Hazards:**
- The cliffs and ravines
- Thin ice on river
- Exposure
- Getting lost in featureless snow

## Historical Context

- Human use for 12,000+ years
- Permanent water = always attracted settlement/travel
- Fort Niobrara established 1880 as Army outpost (after novel's period)
- In 1850s: Lakota territory, contested land

## Useful for Revision

- The cliff-and-valley terrain = dramatic landscape for pursuit/tracking
- The six ecosystems = variety in landscape description
- The waterfalls = potential set-piece or landmark
- Coyote calls = soundscape of loneliness
- The paper birch at edge of its range = a kind of displaced, out-of-place thing (like Farrell? Morrow?)
- Silence as dominant feature = matches psychological state
- Buffalo seeking shelter along waterways = where Morrow would wait
