# Winter Travel on the Great Plains

Research compiled for *White Buffalo* revision. Farrell's journey takes place November 1858–February 1859.

## The Route

**Great Platte River Road:**
- Principal emigrant pathway from mid-1840s to 1860s
- From Missouri River outposts (Fort Kearny) toward Salt Lake, California, Oregon
- An estimated 250,000 travelers used it during 1841-1866
- Traffic so heavy in 1849-1852 that "virtually all feed for grazing livestock was stripped from both sides of the river"

**Army Improvements (1856-1858):**
- Road construction, improved arroyo crossings, bridges
- Water sources like Barrel Springs improved
- Army recognized travel was difficult due to "lack of water, grass and fuel"

**Winter Reality:**
- Most emigrants avoided winter travel entirely
- Mountain passes blocked by snow
- Alternative "Mormon Road" developed for winter—Salt Lake to Los Angeles

## What Goes Wrong

### Horses and Mules

**Cottonwood Bark—The Critical Distinction:**
- When grass buried in snow, inner bark of cottonwood could sustain horses
- BUT only SWEET cottonwood works
- Narrowleaf (bitter) cottonwood: horses won't eat it and starve
- "To our utter surprise and discomfiture, on presenting it to them they would not eat it"
- Lewis and Clark knew the difference; later travelers sometimes didn't
- This killed entire horse herds in winter 1831-32

**Oxen vs. Horses:**
- Oxen and mules "greatly preferred for their endurance and strength over horses in the dry semi-arid terrain"
- Horses more vulnerable to plains conditions

**Winter Feeding:**
- For each 10°F below 30°F, horses need additional 2 lbs feed/day
- Add 10-15 mph winds: add 4-8 lbs/day
- No shelter + wet/windy: add 10-14 lbs/day
- A single horse in bad conditions could need 20+ extra lbs hay daily

### Weather

**The Winter of 1856-57:**
- Known as "Winter of Deep Snow"
- "The most terrible [winter] they had spent in Nebraska"
- Began with life-taking storm on December 1

**General Conditions:**
- Temperatures frequently plunged below zero for days
- Blizzards creating whiteout conditions
- Snow accumulation that barely melted
- Trains stopped running, stranding communities for months

**Without Shelter:**
- Horses tolerate temperatures to 0°F if no wind/moisture
- With shelter, down to -40°F
- Without shelter in wet/wind: deadly

### Horse Trouble

**Signs of Cold Stress:**
- Shivering = first sign, means core temp has started dropping
- "If they only do it for a little while, they'll be fine"
- Continuous shivering for hours = serious, need intervention
- Other signs: reluctance to move, cold back, lethargy, weak pulse

**Wet is Deadly:**
- Wet fur cannot insulate
- Wet or damp horses highly susceptible to hypothermia
- A sweaty horse in cold = major problem (must cool down properly)
- Most hypothermia cases: horses falling through ice, stuck in mud

**Exhaustion in Deep Snow:**
- Deep snow = resistance training, hard work
- Can cause tendon injuries in unfit horses
- Signs of exhaustion: elevated pulse/respiration, depression, unwillingness to continue, weakness, stiffness
- Unfit or unsound horses much more vulnerable

**The Fall Rate:**
- Horses fell on average once every 100 miles of travel
- Ice, hidden holes, uneven ground all hazards
- A lame horse in winter = potentially fatal situation

**What They Need:**
- Roughage (hay) generates heat through digestion
- Must chop ice for water twice daily
- Shelter from wind critical
- Indian ponies "on lean times" in winter, usually not ridden much
- Army horses struggled when they outran their supply trains

### Getting Lost/Stranded

**The Martin Handcart Company (1856):**
- Crossed Platte River, then heavy snow fell for three days
- Company halted near Red Butte
- Nine days stranded
- 56 persons died from cold or disease

**Stuart's Party:**
- War party captured all their horses
- "Afoot in unfamiliar country, a thousand miles from any settlement, without supplies and on the sharp edge of a Rocky Mountain winter"

## Provisions and Survival

**What to Carry:**
- Coffee, sugar, tobacco
- Flour, dried beans
- Whatever game could be hunted
- Jerked meat if prepared in advance

**Trail Guide Wisdom (1858):**
- "But little allowance should be made upon any expectation of procuring game by the way, for if you get any, you will be fortunate, unless you call fish game"
- Traveling without adequate provisions = "guarantee for starvation"

**Survival Foods:**
- Jerked meat: thin strips (half-inch thick), lean meat only, from antelope, deer, elk, or buffalo
- Pemmican: dried meat pounded fine, mixed with melted fat and marrow, plus dried wild cherry paste
- Buffalo tongue, liver, hump ribs—the choice parts
- When game scarce, "even the toughest parts of the meat"

**Fuel:**
- If no wood: "buffalo chips" (dried dung)
- Cottonwood for fires and shelter poles

## Wild Game Available

**In the Platte Valley (1860s, similar to late 1850s):**
- "A great many deer, antelope, and an occasional elk"
- Buffalo "abounded by hundreds of thousands" a few miles from the main trail
- Wild turkeys, rabbits along streams
- Squirrel common

**But Reality:**
- Main trail stripped of game
- Need to venture away from thoroughfare
- Hunting difficult in winter conditions

## Trapper/Frontiersman Winter Life

**Winter Camps:**
- Built solid shelters to keep warm and dry
- Stayed close to camps
- Still had to hunt for food, wood, water
- "This kind of work was even more difficult to accomplish in winter"

**When Game Plentiful:**
- Trappers gorged on best parts: tongue, liver, hump ribs
- When scarce, ate everything

## Useful for Revision

- The sweet/bitter cottonwood distinction = potential incident (does Farrell know?)
- The 1856-57 "Winter of Deep Snow" is recent memory for anyone on the plains
- The stripping of game near the main trail = why Farrell might venture off-route
- Martin Handcart disaster (1856) = recent, would be known
- The slow accumulation of problems: cold, hunger, exhaustion, isolation
