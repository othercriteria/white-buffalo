## v0.5 - Ending Revision (2026-01-07)

- Cut Chapter Twelve entirely (Lakota POV, intercut structure); moved to scratch/
- Cut rescue fragments and thematic summary from end of Chapter Eleven
- Added Lakota acknowledgment: leader sees Farrell, chooses to turn away
- Added horse presence at end: lifeline made explicit, survival path clear
- Expanded homestead supplies passage in Chapter Six (cache as waypoint)
- New final line: "nothing left to follow"

~33k words (down from ~34k). Ending now earns its ambiguity rather than evading commitment. Farrell's survival is plausible but undetermined; the novel ends at the moment before decision.

## v0.4 - Continuity Pass (2026-01-07)

- Eliminated tent/stove from Morrow's camp; now survives in natural shelters (hollows, cutbanks) consistent with his minimalist existence
- Fixed winter count: "second winter" → "third winter" in Journal VIII
- Fixed homesteader timeline: Hardins now arrive spring 1857 (consistent with Journal V first sighting), not 1856
- Fixed Spirit Lake reference: "years ago" → "last year" (massacre was March 1857)

~34k words. Timeline and material culture now internally consistent.

## v0.3 - Revised (2026-01-06)

- Cut murder confession from Journal Entry VII; revelation now through Farrell's reading in Ch 10
- Thinned vision/hallucination repetitions in Chapters 8-10
- Varied repeated phrasing ("dead eyes and silent mouths")

~34k words. Visions still present but less routine; Hardin murders land as discovery rather than confirmation.

---

## v0.2 - Expanded (2026-01-05)

- Added journey texture: storm night before Fort Kearny, six-day trek to homestead, failing horse, winter soundscape
- Removed hired hand (Thomas Carver) for logical consistency with two-person homestead
- Created research reference documents (Mexican War, winter travel, DTs, Lakota traditions, Niobrara ecology)

~34k words (up from ~32k). Added "micro-structure of frustrations" - land as indifferent antagonist.

---

## v0.1 - First Draft (2026-01-04)

- Complete structure: 12 Farrell chapters, 9 Morrow journal entries
- Intercalated narrative established
- Full arc from Aldridge hiring through white buffalo's departure

~32k words. Functional draft; pacing and voice consistent throughout.
