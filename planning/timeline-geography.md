## Historical Context

### Mexican-American War (1846-1848)

Both protagonist and follower served in this war. Key facts:

- ~90,000 U.S. soldiers served; ~31,000 regulars, ~59,000 state volunteers
- New York supplied two full volunteer regiments (Cols. Stevenson and Burnett)
- Harsh conditions: low pay, brutal discipline for regulars, lax discipline for volunteers
- High desertion rate (~10% of regulars, ~7% of volunteers) - highest in any American war
- Disease killed more than combat
- Many future Civil War officers on both sides gained experience here

**Key battles our characters may have experienced:**
- Monterrey (September 1846) - brutal urban combat
- Buena Vista (February 1847) - outnumbered 3-to-1, close-quarters fighting, heavy volunteer casualties
- Cerro Gordo (April 1847) - mountain pass battle
- Mexico City campaign (August-September 1847) - Churubusco, Molino del Rey, Chapultepec

The protagonist and follower likely served in a New York volunteer regiment or attached to regulars. Buena Vista and the Mexico City campaign offer the most visceral material.

### Great Plains 1850s

- **1851**: Fort Laramie Treaty - U.S. gains right to build roads/forts; tribes get defined territories
- **1854**: Kansas-Nebraska Act opens territory to settlement
- **1854**: Grattan Massacre triggers First Sioux War
- **1855**: Harney's attack on Blue Water Creek (136 Lakota killed)
- Late 1850s: Sporadic violence, uneasy peace, sparse settlement

**Tribal nations present:**
- Lakota (Sioux) - dominant, especially Oglala and Brulé bands
- Cheyenne and Arapaho - allied with Lakota
- Pawnee - semi-sedentary, enemies of Lakota, often allied with U.S.
- Crow - enemies of Lakota, further west

## Geography

### The Journey

**Starting point: Oswego, New York**
- Lake Ontario port city, booming in 1850s
- Erie Canal system nearby
- Wilderness (Adirondacks) within reach - where protagonist does irregular work

**Route westward:**
1. Oswego → Syracuse (canal/road)
2. Syracuse → Buffalo (Erie Canal or rail by 1850s)
3. Buffalo → Cleveland → Chicago (rail/lake steamer)
4. Chicago → Rock Island or Quincy (rail)
5. Cross Mississippi, continue to Council Bluffs or Omaha
6. Follow Platte River corridor westward into Nebraska Territory

Total distance: ~1,500 miles. In winter conditions, 2-3 months of hard travel.

### The Setting: Niobrara River Region

**Why this location works:**
- Northern Nebraska Territory / southern Dakota Territory
- White buffalo range
- Lakota territory (Brulé and Oglala bands)
- Sparse settlement in late 1850s - only a few homesteaders
- Severe winters
- Far enough from main trails to feel isolated

**Specific geography:**
- Niobrara River flows west to east across northern Nebraska
- Rolling sand hills to the south
- Pine Ridge escarpment to the northwest
- Black Hills visible in the distance to the north
- Winter: deep snow, bitter cold, wind-scoured prairie

### Key Locations in the Story

1. **Hardin homestead** - On or near the Niobrara River, perhaps where a creek joins it. Sod house or crude log structure.

2. **Follower's camp** - Mobile, following the buffalo. When protagonist finds it: a hollow in a cutbank, a bedroll, few possessions, signs of long solitary habitation.

3. **The final scene** - Open prairie, perhaps a slight rise. The white buffalo visible. The follower's body in the snow. Lakota horsemen in the distance, leading the buffalo away toward the Black Hills.

## White Buffalo Significance

- Extremely rare: 1 in 10 million buffalo births
- Sacred to Lakota: White Buffalo Calf Woman brought the Sacred Pipe and Seven Sacred Rites
- A white buffalo is "the most sacred living thing on earth" to the Lakota
- Its appearance is prophetic - sign of hope, good times to come, but also a warning
- The follower's obsession inverts this: he seeks death from the sacred, not blessing

## Delirium Tremens (DTs)

The protagonist experiences this as he approaches the climax. Symptoms to portray:

**Timeline:** 48-72 hours after last drink, can extend to 7-10 days

**Physical symptoms:**
- Tremor (especially hands)
- Profuse sweating
- Rapid heartbeat
- Nausea, vomiting
- Fever

**Mental symptoms:**
- Confusion, disorientation
- Visual hallucinations (often insects, snakes, rats - but we'll use other imagery)
- Auditory hallucinations
- Tactile hallucinations (formication - sensation of things crawling on skin)
- "Feelings of impending doom"
- Anxiety, terror
- Nightmares that blur into waking

**For the narrative:**
- Protagonist's unreliability increases as he approaches the end
- The Lakota leading the buffalo away *could* be real, or could be DT hallucination
- His perceptions become increasingly dreamlike
- The journal entries become an anchor of relative clarity

## The Impending Civil War

Both men know the state of the Union in 1858-1859:
- Bleeding Kansas (1854-1859) - ongoing guerrilla war over slavery
- Dred Scott decision (1857) - inflamed tensions
- Lincoln-Douglas debates (1858) - slavery the defining issue
- John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry (October 1859) - just after our story ends

They've served under officers who will lead armies:
- Zachary Taylor (died 1850 as President)
- Winfield Scott (will remain with Union)
- Jefferson Davis (will lead Confederacy)
- Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, many others (junior officers in Mexico)

The protagonist and follower have seen what these men can do. They know war is coming. This is subtext, not text - it shadows everything without being stated directly.
