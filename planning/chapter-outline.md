# Chapter Outline

## Structure

The novel alternates between:
- **Protagonist chapters** (first person, Henry Farrell): His journey west, discovery, and final confrontation
- **Journal entries** (first person, Josiah Morrow): Chronological excerpts from the follower's journal, roughly converging with the protagonist's timeline

**Frame chapters** (third person):
- Opening: Ephraim Aldridge seeks out Farrell
- Closing: The Lakota lead the white buffalo away

The journal entries become more frequent as the novel progresses. The reader should understand fairly early that they're reading someone's journal, but the connection to the protagonist's story clarifies when Farrell finds the journal.

## Part One: The Commission

### Chapter 1 - [Third person frame]
*~3,000 words*

Ephraim Aldridge travels from his offices in Oswego to find Henry Farrell. November 1858. We see Aldridge's world - prosperous, ordered, anxious beneath the surface. He inquires after a man who does certain kinds of work. He's directed to a boarding house, then to a logging camp, then to a particular tavern.

Aldridge finds Farrell. The two men take the measure of each other. Aldridge explains: his daughter Catherine, married against his wishes, went west with her husband two years ago. Her letters stopped eight months ago. He believes his son-in-law has killed her. He wants Farrell to find the truth and, if Catherine is dead, to "deal with" George Hardin.

Farrell accepts. Money changes hands. Aldridge leaves quickly, as if afraid Farrell might change his mind - or that he himself might.

### Journal Entry I
*~1,500 words*

Spring 1856. Josiah Morrow, somewhere on the northern plains. He has been wandering for months, or years. He writes of the emptiness, his purpose. Then: he sees the white buffalo calf. A female, pure white, apart from the herd. He knows what he must do. But the calf is small, vulnerable. He cannot die by something that cannot kill him. He must wait.

### Chapter 2 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,000 words*

Farrell prepares to leave. We learn about his life - the boarding house, the irregular work, the drinking. He doesn't dwell on Mexico, but it surfaces in fragments. He knows he's being sent to probably confirm a woman's death and possibly kill a man. This doesn't trouble him much.

The journey begins. Buffalo to Cleveland by rail. We see mid-century America - crowded, busy, indifferent. Farrell is a man moving through a world that has forgotten him.

### Journal Entry II
*~1,500 words*

Summer 1856. Morrow has been following the calf for weeks. He describes learning her patterns, staying near but not too near. He eats poorly, sleeps little. Other buffalo tolerate his presence at a distance. He has begun to feel that he is being refined, stripped down to essential purpose.

### Chapter 3 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,000 words*

Chicago, then westward into Iowa. The landscape opens. Farrell's drinking is steady - he ensures supply. Conversations with fellow travelers, overheard news. The nation is tearing itself apart over slavery. Kansas bleeds. Farrell thinks of the officers he served under, what they're capable of.

He crosses the Mississippi. Council Bluffs. He outfits for the final leg: horse, supplies, enough whiskey. Winter is coming.

---

## Part Two: The Journey

### Journal Entry III
*~2,000 words*

Autumn 1856. The calf is growing. Morrow writes about her with increasing tenderness. He has given her no name - she is simply "the white buffalo" or "she." He reflects on his time in Mexico, obliquely. He saw things there. He did things. The white buffalo is his answer to what he became.

### Chapter 4 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,500 words*

Farrell moves west along the Platte River corridor. Early December. The cold is serious now. He passes Fort Kearny, encounters soldiers, traders, a few late-season travelers. He asks about the Hardin homestead. People are vague - it's north, off the main trail, on the Niobrara maybe.

He also hears, for the first time, about "the man who follows the white buffalo." A trapper mentions it. Then a soldier. A strange figure, seen at a distance. They speak of him like a ghost story.

### Journal Entry IV
*~1,500 words*

Winter 1856-1857. Morrow survives his first winter with the buffalo. Brutal cold, near-starvation. He writes little - the entries are terse, focused on survival. The white buffalo survives too. He sees Lakota at a distance, watching. They do not approach.

### Chapter 5 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,500 words*

Farrell turns north from the Platte, into emptier country. The Niobrara drainage. Harder going now - deep snow, bitter wind. His whiskey supply is adequate but he rations carefully.

He finds a small trading post, barely more than a sod house. The man there knows of the Hardins - they were up the river, maybe two days' ride. Haven't been seen since late summer. "Probably smart enough to get out before winter." Farrell knows better.

More stories of the man and the white buffalo. The trader saw him once, months ago. "Didn't seem right in the head. But not dangerous. Just... elsewhere."

### Journal Entry V
*~2,000 words*

Spring-Summer 1857. The white buffalo is maturing. Morrow describes her physically - the power developing in her frame, the way she moves. He feels himself fading as she grows stronger. This is correct. He mentions seeing a homestead being built, far to the south. Notes it without comment.

### Chapter 6 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,000 words*

Farrell continues up the Niobrara. Christmas passes, unmarked. He's running low on whiskey. The first symptoms of withdrawal begin - restless sleep, tremor in his hands. He knows what's coming if he can't resupply.

He finds the Hardin homestead. Sod house, small barn, the beginnings of a farm. All under snow. No smoke from the chimney. No movement.

---

## Part Three: The Dead

### Journal Entry VI
*~2,500 words*

Autumn 1857. Morrow writes about the white buffalo's first year completed. She is large now, powerful. He estimates another year before she could kill a man. He is patient. He describes, briefly, watching the homesteaders work. A man, a woman. They do not see him. He feels nothing toward them.

### Chapter 7 - [First person, Farrell]
*~5,000 words*

Farrell investigates the homestead. The door is not barred. Inside: signs of violence, long-cleaned. He finds the graves behind the barn. Three of them. Dug by hand, covered with rocks to keep animals out. No markers.

He considers his options. He could turn back now. He has enough evidence to report to Aldridge: the daughter is dead, the son-in-law probably too. But he doesn't turn back. He doesn't fully understand why. Perhaps he wants to see the white buffalo. Perhaps he's tired of turning back.

He searches the homestead more carefully. Finds signs that someone else was here after the killings - the graves were not dug by whoever killed them. Near the graves: a torn journal page, deliberately placed, weighted with a stone. Used to soak up blood from the burials. The writing is mostly obscured by dark stains, but a few words remain legible: "...the white buffalo..." and "...necessary..." The page was not lost; it was offered.

### Journal Entry VII
*~2,000 words*

Summer 1858. Morrow writes about watching the homesteaders for weeks. The white buffalo's path has brought her near their land. Morrow is troubled. These people are not threats, but they could become threats. He describes his thinking, step by step. He does not hate them. But they are in the way.

### Chapter 8 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,500 words*

Farrell's withdrawal worsens. Tremors, sweats, broken sleep. He finds the last of his whiskey, drinks it, knows it only delays the inevitable. He must decide: return for resupply, or continue.

He continues. The stories of the man and the white buffalo have become a compass. He doesn't know exactly what he expects to find. But he's past the point of rational decision.

He picks up a trail - signs of someone moving through the snow, not long ago. A few days, maybe a week. Following an animal's path.

---

## Part Four: The Journal

### Journal Entry VIII
*~2,500 words*

Late summer 1858. Morrow kills the Hardins. He writes about it factually. He approached at dawn. The man came out first. Then the woman came to the door. He buried them himself, taking two days. He took nothing. He writes: "I did not know I would feel this. I thought I was past feeling."

### Chapter 9 - [First person, Farrell]
*~5,000 words*

Farrell is deep in DTs now. The world becomes unreliable. He sees things that may or may not be real - shadows moving, figures at the edge of vision. He talks to people who aren't there. But he keeps moving. The trail is clear enough even to his addled mind.

He thinks about Mexico. Memories surface unbidden. The assault on Chapultepec. What he saw, what he did. He never talked about it. But now, in the fever-dream of withdrawal, it comes back.

He realizes he has something in common with whoever killed the Hardins. Not sympathy, exactly. Recognition.

### Journal Entry IX
*~2,000 words*

Autumn 1858. Morrow observes the white buffalo through her second autumn. She is fully grown now. She could kill him. But she doesn't. He must provoke her, he realizes. Simply dying nearby would not be enough. He must make her kill him deliberately.

He writes about his plan. It is not complicated. He will approach her in a way that triggers her defensive instinct. He will not fight back.

He writes about the Lakota. He has seen them more frequently. Watching. He understands, now, what the white buffalo means to them. He is taking something sacred. Adding it to his long list of transgressions.

### Chapter 10 - [First person, Farrell]
*~4,500 words*

Farrell finds the camp. A canvas tent, half-collapsed under snow. A small fire pit, cold. Signs of long habitation and recent departure. Inside the tent: few possessions, neatly arranged. And a journal, leather-bound, sitting on a folded blanket as if left to be found.

Farrell reads. The journal entries we've been reading now have a source. Farrell reads for hours, into the night, by the light of a fire he manages to build. His hands shake. The words swim. But he reads.

---

## Part Five: The White Buffalo

### Journal Entry X (Final entry)
*~1,500 words*

Early winter 1858, undated. Morrow writes his last entry. He is calm. He writes about what he hopes will happen, what he believes will happen. He addresses no one - or perhaps everyone. He writes about Mexico, finally, directly. What he saw at Buena Vista. What he did. How he has been waiting to die ever since, and how this death will mean something.

He goes out to meet the white buffalo.

### Chapter 11 - [First person, Farrell]
*~5,000 words*

Dawn. Farrell leaves the tent, journal in hand. He is very sick now. The DTs peak. He hallucinates constantly. He's not sure what's real.

He walks toward a shape in the snow, not far from the camp. A man's body, lying face-down. Dead, but not long - the cold has preserved him. Farrell turns him over. A man he doesn't recognize, but somehow knows. The face is at peace.

No visible wound at first. Then Farrell sees it: the chest crushed, ribs broken inward. Killed by blunt force. Trampled. Gored.

He looks up. The white buffalo is there, perhaps fifty yards away. Watching him. Blood, dried and darkened, visible on her chest and forelegs.

Farrell could try to kill her. He has a rifle. But he doesn't raise it. He doesn't know why. Perhaps he's too sick. Perhaps he understands something.

The white buffalo watches him for a long moment. Then she turns away.

### Chapter 12 - [Third person frame]
*~3,000 words*

The perspective pulls back. We see Farrell, small against the winter landscape, kneeling by Morrow's body. We see the white buffalo moving away across the snow.

Then we see them: three or four Lakota horsemen, appearing from the north. They approach the white buffalo. She goes to them willingly, or seems to. They do not look at Farrell. He is irrelevant to their purpose.

They lead her away, toward the Black Hills, toward the sacred places. The white buffalo, which killed the man who followed her, now follows others. The sacred returns to those who hold it sacred.

Farrell watches until they disappear. Or until he can no longer see. It's not clear which.

He is alone with the body, the journal, the endless white. What happens to him next is not the story's concern.

## Word Count Estimate

| Section | Chapters | Words |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Part One | Ch 1-3, JE I-II | ~14,000 |
| Part Two | Ch 4-6, JE III-V | ~18,500 |
| Part Three | Ch 7-8, JE VI-VII | ~16,000 |
| Part Four | Ch 9-10, JE VIII-IX | ~17,000 |
| Part Five | Ch 11-12, JE X | ~9,500 |

**Total estimate: ~75,000 words**

This runs over the 60,000 target. Options:
1. Trim each chapter by ~20%
2. Compress the journey (Parts Two and Three)
3. Let it run longer

The journey sections (Parts Two and Three) have the most room for compression without losing essential narrative.

## Notes on Execution

**Protagonist's voice:**
- Plain, direct, physical
- Observant of external detail, reticent about interior life
- Dark humor that surfaces rarely
- Fragments and unreliability increase in Parts Four and Five

**Journal voice:**
- More formal, self-taught cadences
- Biblical rhythm without direct quotation
- Increasingly clear and calm as death approaches
- The killings recorded without excuses

**The connection through Mexico:**
- Both men shaped by the same war, different responses
- Protagonist buries it in alcohol; Morrow sublimes it into ritual death
- The reader should feel the parallel without it being stated
- Farrell's "recognition" in Chapter 9 is as close as we get to explicit connection

**The white buffalo:**
- Always described physically, precisely
- Never anthropomorphized
- Her behavior is animal behavior - defensive, territorial
- The sacred meaning is human projection (Morrow's, the Lakota's)
- But the text doesn't dismiss that meaning - it lets it stand

**The ending:**
- Ambiguous about Farrell's survival
- Ambiguous about the Lakota's reality
- Not ambiguous about what happened: Morrow got what he sought
- The white buffalo returns to those who see her rightly
