## Josiah Morrow (The Follower)

**Age at death:** ~34

**Background:**
- Born 1824 in Virginia, family of modest means
- Father was a failed farmer, bitter man
- Josiah worked from childhood - no schooling, taught himself to read
- Deeply religious upbringing, but the religion was harsh, judgmental
- Enlisted in regular Army 1845, age 21

**Mexican-American War service:**
- Served as a private in an infantry regiment
- Saw action at Buena Vista - was in the thick of the worst fighting
- Something broke in him there, or perhaps was revealed
- Discharged 1848

**Post-war years (1848-1856):**
- Wandered west, working odd jobs
- The fixation developed slowly - a death-wish seeking form
- Religious framework gave it shape: he sought a death that *meant* something
- The white buffalo became the vessel for this meaning
- By 1856, he was living on the edges of Lakota territory, waiting

**The encounter and after (1856-1858):**
- Found a white buffalo calf in spring 1856
- Instead of the death he sought, he found a task: protect it until it could kill him
- This gave his life structure, purpose - a terrible kind of peace
- Followed the calf across the plains, through two years
- Killed the Hardins when he perceived them as a threat
- The killing troubled him more than he expected - but not enough to change course
- Wrote in his journal throughout

**Personality:**
- Intense, singular focus
- Not insane in any clinical sense - his logic is coherent, his premises are not
- Capable of genuine observation and even tenderness (toward the buffalo)
- Violence comes easily when his purpose requires it
- No malice toward the Hardins - they were simply in the way

**Physical description:**
- Tall, gaunt from two years of hard living
- Long beard, unkempt
- Eyes that unsettle those who meet them
- Moves like a man who has forgotten other people exist

**Voice (journal entries):**
- More formal than Farrell, reflects his self-taught literacy
- Biblical cadences without direct quotation
- Increasingly clear and calm as the end approaches
- Detail-oriented about the buffalo, sparse about himself
- The killings are recorded matter-of-factly

## Ephraim Aldridge (Father-in-law)

**Age in 1858:** 58

**Background:**
- Born 1800 in Massachusetts
- Successful merchant - started in shipping, diversified into dry goods
- Widower; Catherine was his only child
- Now based in Oswego, NY, overseeing Great Lakes shipping interests

**Relationship to Catherine:**
- Loved her, but in a distant, Victorian way
- Disapproved of her marriage to George Hardin - a farmer, a frontiersman
- They parted on cool terms when she went west

**Why he hires Farrell:**
- Aldridge is not a man who travels into wilderness himself
- He needs someone capable, discreet, expendable
- Farrell is available, clearly capable despite his condition
- The arrangement is mercenary but not without a strange honesty

**Personality:**
- Formal, controlled
- Genuinely suffering beneath the propriety
- Knows he may be sending Farrell to confirm his worst fears

## The Lakota (Final scene)

Three or four Lakota horsemen, leading the white buffalo away.

**If real:**
- They have come to reclaim what is sacred
- The white buffalo is returning to the people
- They do not interact with Farrell - he is irrelevant to them
- Moving toward the Black Hills, perhaps to the Keeper of the Sacred Pipe

**If hallucination:**
- Farrell's dying mind constructs meaning from the scene
- The sacred being led away from profane hands
- A vision of completion he cannot participate in

**In the text:**
- Described precisely, without explaining
- Their reality is left unresolved
- Third-person narration at the end allows distance from Farrell's unreliable perception
