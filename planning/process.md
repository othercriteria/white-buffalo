# Writing Process and Acceptance Criteria

## Phases

### Phase 1: Planning (Complete)
**Exit criteria:**
- Timeline established, internally consistent
- Geography researched, plausible
- Characters named and sketched
- Chapter outline complete with word estimates
- No unresolved contradictions

### Phase 2: First Draft
**Entry criteria:** Phase 1 complete, user approval to proceed

**Process:**
- Draft in chapter order (not journal-entry order)
- Each chapter: write, self-review against checklist, commit
- After each Part: pause for consistency check against earlier Parts

**Exit criteria:**
- All 12 chapters drafted
- All 10 journal entries drafted
- Story complete from opening frame to closing frame
- Total word count within reasonable range of target

### Phase 3: Revision
**Entry criteria:** Complete first draft

**Process:**
- Read full manuscript (or as much as context allows)
- Note inconsistencies, voice problems, pacing issues
- Revise chapter by chapter
- After revision pass: re-verify continuity

**Exit criteria:**
- No known continuity errors
- Voice consistent within each narrator
- Pacing acceptable throughout
- Thematic elements land appropriately

### Phase 4: Polish
**Entry criteria:** Revised draft

**Process:**
- Line-level editing
- Cut unnecessary words/passages
- Ensure prose style matches "mid-century literary Western"
- Final word count adjustment if needed

**Exit criteria:**
- Prose reads cleanly
- No known errors
- Ready for reader

## Chapter-Level Checklist (First Draft)

Before committing a chapter, verify:

### Narrative Function
- [ ] Chapter accomplishes its outlined purpose
- [ ] Advances the story appropriately
- [ ] Ends with momentum toward next chapter/entry

### Voice
- [ ] Farrell chapters: plain, direct, physical, observant
- [ ] Morrow entries: formal, biblical rhythm, increasingly calm
- [ ] Voices are distinct from each other
- [ ] Voice doesn't break (no anachronistic phrasing)

### Consistency
- [ ] Geography matches timeline-geography.md
- [ ] Character details match characters.md
- [ ] Weather/season appropriate to timeline
- [ ] Physical details (distances, travel times) plausible

### Information Flow
- [ ] Farrell doesn't know things he hasn't learned yet
- [ ] Reader learns things in intended order
- [ ] No unearned revelations

### Period Authenticity
- [ ] No anachronistic language
- [ ] No 21st-century conceptual framings (e.g., "trauma")
- [ ] Material culture accurate (weapons, clothing, transportation)
- [ ] Social dynamics appropriate to 1858

### Craft
- [ ] No over-writing (purple prose, excessive interiority)
- [ ] No under-writing (rushed, thin)
- [ ] Sensory details present but not overdone
- [ ] Dialogue (if any) sounds like speech, not exposition

## Context Management Strategy

Given ~200k token limit with ~30% overhead, and a target manuscript of ~60k words (~80k tokens):

### During Drafting
- Work on one chapter at a time
- Keep planning docs accessible (they're reference, not context-heavy)
- After drafting 3-4 chapters, may need to rely on summaries of earlier chapters
- Commit frequently so work is preserved

### During Revision
- Use "masking" technique: read all but one Part, write expectations for that Part, then verify after compaction
- Maintain running consistency notes in notes/
- Trust the outline as ground truth for structure

### Continuity Tracking
- After each Part, write brief notes on:
  - Key facts established
  - Character states
  - What Farrell knows/doesn't know
  - Timeline position
- These notes serve as compressed reference

## Project-Specific Constraints

### What Farrell Can Know (by chapter)

| Chapter | Farrell Knows | Farrell Doesn't Know |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1-3 | Commission, Catherine missing, heading west | Who killed settlers, white buffalo man exists |
| 4-5 | Rumors of white buffalo man | Connection to settlers, that settlers are dead |
| 6 | Homestead location, grim expectations | Confirmation of deaths, who did it |
| 7 | Settlers dead, strange killer, torn page hint | Full story, Morrow's identity |
| 8 | Trail to follow, worsening condition | What he'll find |
| 9 | Approaching something, DTs distorting reality | Journal contents |
| 10 | Full journal contents | Whether he'll survive |
| 11-12 | Everything | Whether Lakota are real |

### The Mexico Connection
- Neither man frames their experiences as "trauma" in modern terms
- Farrell buries it in alcohol; surfaces involuntarily in DTs
- Morrow sublimates it into ritual purpose; writes about it obliquely until final entry
- The connection is felt by the reader, stated by neither narrator
- Farrell's "recognition" in Ch 9 is as explicit as we get

### The Impending Civil War
- Present in background: Kansas violence, political news, officer names
- Never commented on directly by either protagonist
- Shadow, not text

### The White Buffalo
- Always physical, animal
- Sacred meaning is human projection
- Her killing Morrow is defensive animal behavior
- Text allows both interpretations (sacred / merely animal) to coexist

### The Ending
- Morrow's death: unambiguous (he got what he sought)
- Lakota: ambiguous (real or DT hallucination)
- Farrell's survival: ambiguous (not the story's concern)

## Self-Review Questions

After each chapter/entry, ask:

1. Does this feel like the same book as what came before?
2. Would a reader who knows this period find it credible?
3. Is there anything clever or cute? (If yes, cut it)
4. Does the prose call attention to itself? (If yes, simplify)
5. What does the reader know now that they didn't before?
6. What question makes them turn the page?
