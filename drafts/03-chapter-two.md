# Chapter Two

The packet Aldridge gave me contained seven letters, a hand-drawn map, and a daguerreotype of a woman I assumed was Catherine Hardin. The letters were written in a neat, educated hand on good paper, the kind that costs money. The map was useless—a sketch of rivers and landmarks that could have been anywhere west of the Mississippi. The daguerreotype showed a young woman with dark hair and pale eyes, her expression composed in the way that daguerreotypes require, holding still for the long exposure. She looked like her father. I did not tell him this.

I read the letters that night in my room at the boarding house. Mrs. Canfield's place, on the edge of town, where I had been staying when I was not in the woods. She charged fifty cents a night and did not ask questions, which was worth more to me than clean sheets.

The early letters were what you would expect. Catherine wrote about the journey west, the vastness of the land, the hardships and excitements of establishing a homestead. She wrote about her husband with affection that seemed genuine enough, though I am not skilled at reading such things. She wrote about missing her father, about hoping he would come to visit, about the life she was building.

The later letters were different. The affection was still there, or the words for it were, but something had shifted underneath. She wrote about difficulties with the farm, about isolation, about a winter that had been harder than expected. She did not complain directly—she was not the type, I gathered—but the shape of the complaints was visible in what she did not say.

There was no mention of children. In nearly three years of marriage, in letters that described every other detail of her life, she said nothing about children born or expected. Whether this was grief or privacy or simple absence, I could not tell. But I noticed it.

The last letter was dated March fourteenth. The winter is finally breaking, she wrote. The snow is melting and the creek is running high. George says the worst is behind us. I hope he is right.

That was all. Nothing to suggest what came after. Nothing to suggest that anything came after at all.

I folded the letters and put them back in the packet. I sat in the dark for a while, listening to the sounds of the boarding house settling around me. Someone coughing in the next room. Footsteps on the stairs. The wind against the window.

Then I took out the bottle I kept in my bag and had a drink, and then another, and eventually I slept.

I spent the next two days settling my affairs. This did not take long, as I had few affairs to settle.

I told Mrs. Canfield I would be gone for some time, perhaps months. She nodded and said she would hold my room if I paid in advance. I paid for a month and told her to rent it out after that if I did not return. She looked at me with something that might have been concern but was probably just calculation, and said nothing.

I went to the lumber office and told Garrett I would not be available for work through the winter. He was unsurprised. He had been the one to tell Aldridge where to find me, and I suspected he had made something off the referral.

"Heading west?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Dangerous country."

"I know."

He looked at me for a moment, then shrugged. "There'll be work when you get back. If you get back."

"I'll get back."

He didn't look convinced. I didn't particularly care.

I bought supplies: a heavy coat, wool blankets, dried meat and hardtack, a new knife. I already had a rifle, a Sharps carbine I had carried since the war. I cleaned it, checked the action, loaded it. It had not failed me yet.

I bought whiskey. Three bottles, wrapped in cloth so they would not clink. This was the supply I cared about most. I knew what waited for me if the supply ran out. I had seen it happen to other men, the shaking and the fever and the visions. I had come close to it myself, once, when a winter storm trapped me in a cabin for two weeks with nothing to drink. I did not intend to come close to it again.

On the morning of the third day, I left.

The railroad had come to this part of the country ten years earlier, and it had changed everything. Towns that had been weeks apart by coach were now hours apart by rail. Goods moved faster. People moved faster. The whole pace of life had accelerated in ways that still felt strange to me, though I had lived through it.

I took the train from Rochester to Buffalo, then from Buffalo to Cleveland. The cars were crowded with passengers of every description: farmers going to market, merchants with their sample cases, families relocating west. Children ran up and down the aisles while their mothers called after them. Men smoked cigars and talked business and politics. Women sat with their hands folded and their eyes on the passing scenery.

I sat by the window and watched the land go by. It was familiar country at first—the rolling hills of western New York, the farms with their tidy fences, the small towns clustered around their stations. Then it flattened out as we approached the lake, and I could see the gray expanse of Erie stretching to the horizon.

I thought about Mexico.

I had not thought about Mexico in some time. I had trained myself not to. But something about this journey—the movement, perhaps, or the sense of going toward something instead of away from it—brought it back.

I had been twenty years old when I enlisted. A young man full of notions about glory and duty and the honor of serving one's country. Those notions had not survived the first month. By the time we reached Monterrey I had forgotten why I had come. By the time we reached Mexico City I had forgotten that I had ever been anyone other than what the war had made me.

The train rattled on. The other passengers talked and laughed and conducted their business. I sat with my bag between my feet and my rifle case beside me and I let the memories come and go without trying to hold them or push them away.

What I remembered most was the waiting. The long hours before an assault, sitting in trenches or behind walls, listening to the guns. The longer hours after, when the fighting was done and there was nothing to do but count the dead and wonder why you were not among them. I had been good at waiting. I had been good at most of what the army required. That was why I had survived.

The train pulled into Cleveland as the sun was setting. I found a hotel near the station, paid for a room, and went to find something to eat. The city was larger than I expected, louder, more crowded. Gaslights lined the main streets, their flames flickering behind glass. People hurried past in both directions, their faces set with purpose.

I ate at a chophouse near the hotel. The food was adequate. The whiskey was better. I had two glasses and then went back to my room and had two more from my own supply.

I thought about Catherine Hardin, alone on a homestead somewhere in the Nebraska Territory. I thought about her husband, who might have killed her, or might simply have failed to protect her from whatever had happened. I thought about Aldridge, back in Oswego now, waiting for news.

I thought about what I would do when I found the truth.

The answer was simple enough. If she was alive, I would bring word back to her father. If she was dead and her husband had killed her, I would kill him. If she was dead and her husband had not killed her—if some other fate had befallen them both—I would bring that word back too.

It was not complicated. These things rarely were, once you stripped away the emotion.

I finished the whiskey and lay down on the bed without undressing. The ceiling was water-stained, the plaster cracked. I watched the cracks in the lamplight until my eyes grew heavy, and then I closed them.

---

The next morning I took the train west to Chicago. The journey took most of the day, the cars swaying and rattling through the flat country of northern Indiana, past farms and woodlots and small towns that all looked the same.

I had been to Chicago once before, years ago, before the war. It had been a rough town then, a place where the prairie met the lake and men did business in mud and blood. It was larger now, more established, but the roughness was still there underneath. You could see it in the faces of the men on the streets, in the way they walked, in the way they looked at strangers.

I found a hotel near the rail yard. The room was small and dirty, but it had a bed and a lock on the door, which was all I required. I stowed my gear and went out to see about transportation west.

The railroad did not extend much past the Mississippi, not yet. There was talk of a transcontinental line, but the talk had been going on for years and would probably go on for years more. For now, if you wanted to go west, you went by coach or by wagon or by horse.

I found a livery stable that sold horses and supplies. The man who ran it was named Hennessey, a thick-necked Irishman with a politician's smile and a horse trader's eyes.

"Heading into the territories?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Alone?"

"Yes."

He looked at me, taking my measure. "Winter's coming hard this year. Word from the plains is it'll be a bad one. Snow already in the Dakotas."

"I've seen snow."

"Not like this you haven't. The Sioux call this kind of winter a white death. Whole camps freeze in their sleep. Whole herds of buffalo drop where they stand."

"I'll take my chances."

He shrugged. "Your funeral. What do you need?"

I bought a horse—a sturdy bay gelding with a calm disposition and good teeth—and tack and saddlebags. I bought additional supplies: more dried food, grain for the horse, ammunition for the Sharps. And I bought three more bottles of whiskey, despite the price, because Hennessey was right about the winter and I knew I would need it.

The total came to more than I had expected. I paid from Aldridge's money and did not worry about it. If I came back, I would collect the other half of my fee. If I did not come back, the money would not matter.

That night I spread my map on the bed and studied it by lamplight. The hand-drawn sketch from Aldridge's packet was useless, but I had bought a proper map in Cleveland, printed by a company that sold such things to settlers and speculators. It showed the rivers and trails, the military posts and trading stations, the boundaries of the territories.

The Niobrara River was there, a thin line running west to east across the northern part of Nebraska Territory. The country around it was largely blank—no towns, no roads, just the shapes of rivers and the word SIOUX written in large letters across the emptiness.

Somewhere in that emptiness, George and Catherine Hardin had built their homestead. Somewhere in that emptiness, I would find out what had happened to them.

I folded the map and put it away. I had another drink, then another. The bottle was nearly empty by the time I finished.

In the morning, I would cross the Mississippi and begin the real journey. Everything before this had been prelude.

I lay back on the bed and listened to the sounds of Chicago through the thin walls—men shouting, a woman laughing, the clatter of a wagon on the cobblestones. The sounds of people living their lives, going about their business, unaware of the emptiness that waited just beyond the edge of the world they knew.

I finished the bottle and let it fall to the floor.
