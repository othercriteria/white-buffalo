# Chapter Ten

I found the camp at dusk.

It was a simple thing—a hollow in the lee of a low hill, where a cutbank offered shelter from the wind. A fire pit sat at the entrance, cold, the ashes scattered by the wind. There were no animals, no supplies, no signs that anyone had lived here except a bedroll laid out in the hollow and the tracks that led away toward the north.

The man I had been following was gone. The tracks told me that much—a single set of footprints, fresh enough that the wind had not yet filled them in, leading out of the camp and down into the valley below. He had left this morning, perhaps, or late last night. He was not far.

But I did not follow him. Not yet.

I dismounted and tied my horse to a stunted pine at the edge of the camp. My hands were shaking—they had been shaking for days—and it took me three tries to secure the knot. The cold pressed in from all sides, and the light was failing, and the soldiers were there at the edges of the darkness, watching, patient as stones.

"Wait here," I told them. They did not answer.

I walked to the hollow and knelt at its edge.

---

The hollow was perhaps six feet deep, carved by water or wind into the side of the hill. A bedroll lay at the back, the blankets neatly arranged, waiting for someone who would not return. A few possessions were scattered about—a knife, a tin cup, a bundle of clothes so worn they barely deserved the name.

And on the bedroll, sitting as if left to be found, a leather-bound book.

I picked it up. It was heavier than it looked, the pages thick and dense with writing. The cover was stained—dirt, and something darker that might have been blood—but the binding was intact. Someone had taken care of this book. Someone had written in it, day after day, for what looked like years.

I opened it to the first page.

*April the Nineteenth, Eighteen Fifty-Six,* it read. *I have walked a long time. I do not know how long. The days blur together on the plains...*

I sat down on the cold ground and began to read.

---

I read until the light failed completely, and then I built a fire at the mouth of the hollow and read by its light. I read through the night, turning page after page, watching a man's life unfold in careful, formal handwriting.

His name was Josiah Morrow. He was from Virginia. He had served in the Mexican War, in the same battles I had served in, under officers whose names I recognized. He had come back from the war broken in a way I understood, and he had spent years looking for something to make him whole again.

He had found the white buffalo.

I read about the day he first saw her, a white calf moving through the brown grass. I read about the decision he made—to follow her, to wait for her to grow, to die by her hooves when she was ready. I read about the winters he survived and the summers he endured and the slow, patient years of watching and waiting.

And I read about the Hardins.

He had watched them for weeks, he wrote. He had seen them building their home, working their land, living their small and hopeful lives. He had felt nothing toward them—no hatred, no sympathy, no connection of any kind. But they were in the way. They could have seen her. They could have threatened her. And so he had killed them.

*I did not know I would feel this,* he had written afterward. *I thought I was past feeling.*

But he was not past feeling. The killing had troubled him, had disturbed the careful emptiness he had cultivated. He had buried them himself, taken two days to do it properly, left a page from his journal as a marker or a confession. And then he had moved on, following the white buffalo, waiting for the end.

---

The fire burned low as I read the final entries. He had grown calm as the end approached, his writing clearer, more certain. He knew what he was going to do. He knew what it would cost.

*She can take this hollow thing I have become and unmake it,* he had written. *She can give my death a meaning that my life never had.*

I set the journal down and looked into the fire. The flames danced and flickered, casting shadows on the snow. The soldiers stood around me in a circle, watching, waiting. Catherine Hardin was among them now, her pale face turned toward me, her eyes asking questions I could not answer.

I had come all this way to find a killer. I had found something else instead.

I had found a man who was not so different from me. A man shaped by the same war, broken by the same violence, hollowed out by the same emptiness. He had made different choices—worse choices, choices I could not forgive—but the raw material was the same. We were two men formed from the same clay, fired in the same kiln.

The difference was that he had found something to die for. And I had not.

---

I slept for a few hours, the journal clutched to my chest like a talisman. The dreams were bad—Mexico, always Mexico, the blood and the smoke and the faces of the dead—but I was used to bad dreams. I woke before dawn and lay in the cold, listening to the wind, thinking about what I was going to do.

I could turn back. The journal was evidence, proof of what had happened to the Hardins, a document that could be taken to Aldridge and presented as the resolution of his commission. The man who killed your daughter is dead, I could tell him. This is his confession. Justice has been done, or something close to it.

But the man who killed his daughter was not dead. Not yet.

The tracks leading from the camp were still fresh enough to follow. The valley below, where I had seen him yesterday, was perhaps a mile away. If I moved now, in the gray light before sunrise, I might find him. I might see, at last, the thing he had been seeking.

I did not know why I wanted to see it. I did not know what I expected to find. But I gathered my things and saddled my horse and rode down into the valley, the journal in my saddlebag, the dead men following behind.

The white buffalo was waiting.
