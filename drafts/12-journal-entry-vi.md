# Journal Entry VI

*September the Eighth, Eighteen Fifty-Seven*

One year.

It has been one year since I first saw her, white against the brown grass, moving apart from the herd. One year since I understood what I must do, and what I must wait for. One year of walking and watching and surviving through a winter that tried its best to kill me.

She has changed in that year. So have I.

*September the Fifteenth*

I have been watching her closely these past weeks, trying to measure her against what she was when I first found her. The difference is remarkable.

She is large now—not full-grown, not yet, but large enough that she stands taller than most of the cows in the herd. Her coat has thickened for the coming winter, and it gleams in the autumn light, white with that silver undertone that appears when the sun catches it at certain angles. Her eyes are dark and liquid and watchful, and when she looks at me I can no longer tell if what I see there is recognition or simply the blank attention of an animal assessing a potential threat.

Her power is visible in everything she does. When she walks, the muscles shift beneath her skin in complex patterns that speak of strength held in reserve. When she runs—which she does, sometimes, for no reason I can determine—the ground trembles beneath her hooves. When she lowers her head to graze, the hump of muscle behind her neck rises like a wave about to break.

She could kill me now. I have no doubt of that. One charge, one blow of her head, one strike of her hooves, and I would be done. But I do not think she would do it. Not yet. There is something unfinished between us, some understanding that has not yet been reached.

Another year, I think. Perhaps less. By next autumn, she will be fully grown—a thousand pounds or more of bone and muscle and wild instinct. By next autumn, she will be ready.

And so will I.

*September the Twenty-Ninth*

The homesteaders are still here.

I saw them again today, working in the field beside their sod house. The man was cutting hay—late in the season for it, but perhaps they had no choice. The woman was gathering something from a garden plot near the door, moving between the rows with a basket over her arm.

They have been here since early summer. I remember first seeing them then, working on the land with the hope that brings settlers to this country. They seemed so certain that they were building something that would last.

I wonder if they still feel that way. The first winter is the hardest, they say, and they have survived it. But the winters do not get easier. The isolation does not get easier. The land does not soften to accommodate the people who try to live on it.

They will stay or they will go. It is not my concern.

*October the Twelfth*

I have been thinking about time.

Before I came out here, time meant something. The days had names and the weeks had purposes and the years accumulated into something that could be measured, counted, compared. I was thirty-two years old when I left Virginia. I knew that number, held it in my mind as a fact about myself, one of many facts that together made up the shape of who I was.

Now I am thirty-three, or perhaps thirty-four. I have lost track. The days still pass, but they have lost their names. The seasons change, but they do not mean what they used to mean. I am no longer measuring my life in years. I am measuring it in terms of her—her growth, her development, the slow accumulation of power that will one day end me.

This is a better way to measure, I think. Time moves differently when you stop counting it. The days become longer and shorter at once, heavy with meaning and light with consequence. The past recedes, the future approaches, and the present expands to fill the space between them.

I am here, now, watching her. That is the only measurement that matters.

*October the Twenty-Eighth*

The herd is preparing for winter. I can see the signs—the restlessness, the movement toward the southern ranges, the thickening of coats. They have done this for thousands of years, these animals, following the same patterns across the same land, surviving what the seasons throw at them. They do not question or complain or wish for something different. They simply endure.

I am learning to be more like them.

The supplies I brought with me are nearly exhausted. My knife is dull, my clothes are worn, my body is thinner than it has ever been. But these things do not trouble me as they once would have. I have learned to eat what the land provides, to shelter where the wind is blocked, to move when movement is needed and rest when rest is possible.

I have become simpler. More essential. Stripped of everything that was not necessary for this one purpose.

*November the Fifth*

I watched the homesteaders again today. Closer this time—perhaps a quarter mile from their house, hidden in a stand of cottonwoods on the ridge above them.

The woman was hanging laundry. The man was repairing something on the barn. They moved around each other with the easy familiarity of people who have lived together for a long time, anticipating each other's movements, filling each other's silences. Once, the woman laughed at something the man said, and the sound carried up to where I sat, clear and bright against the gray of the autumn sky.

I felt nothing.

I expected to feel something. Envy, perhaps, for what they have. Regret, for what I gave up. Even anger, for the simplicity of their happiness, the way they seem to believe that building a house and working the land and loving each other is enough to justify a life.

But there was nothing. I watched them as I would watch birds or deer or any other creatures going about their business. They were not real to me. They were not part of the world I inhabit now.

The herd moved on, and I moved with it. The homesteaders stayed where they were, in their little house, with their little life, their little hopes for a future that may or may not arrive.

I do not wish them ill. I do not wish them anything. They are simply there, like the grass and the sky and the wind. Part of the landscape. Nothing more.

*November the Nineteenth*

She stood apart from the herd today, grazing alone at the edge of a frozen creek. I watched her for hours, sitting on a rise perhaps two hundred yards away, while the light changed and the shadows lengthened and the cold crept into my bones.

She is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

I do not say this lightly. I have seen beautiful things in my life—the mountains of Virginia in autumn, the Gulf of Mexico at sunset, a woman's face by candlelight in a time before the war. But none of them compare to her. None of them carry the weight she carries, the meaning she represents.

She is sacred. I know this now with a certainty I have not felt about anything else in my life. The Indians are right to revere her, right to see her as a message from whatever powers govern this world. She does not belong to the ordinary realm of animals and grass and weather. She belongs to something higher, something I cannot name.

And she will kill me.

That is the other thing I know with certainty. Someday—next autumn, perhaps, or the autumn after—she will turn on me. The instinct that has kept her wary will become the instinct that drives her to attack. And when that happens, I will not run. I will not fight. I will stand before her and let her do what she was made to do.

I am ready. I have been ready for a long time.

But she is not ready yet. And so I wait.

*December the First*

Winter is here.

The snow has begun to fall, and the herd has settled into its winter patterns, moving slowly through the valleys, conserving strength for the months ahead. She is with them, as always, her white coat blending with the snow until she is almost invisible.

I have found a place to shelter—a hollow in the bluffs where the wind cannot reach, where I can build small fires and survive the worst of the cold. It is not far from where the herd has gathered. I can watch them from here, can see her white form moving among the brown, can keep the vigil I have kept for a year and will keep for however long it takes.

The homesteaders will be in their sod house now, huddled around their stove, waiting out the winter as I wait out the winter. I wonder if they think of the spring, of the planting and building they will do when the snow melts. I wonder if they dream of the future, of children and harvests and years stretching out before them.

I do not dream anymore. I do not think of the future beyond the moment when she and I will face each other for the last time.

That moment is coming. I can feel it approaching, as surely as I can feel the cold pressing in from all sides.

I can wait.
