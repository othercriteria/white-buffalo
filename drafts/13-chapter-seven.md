# Chapter Seven

I did not sleep well.

The stove kept the worst of the cold at bay, but it could not keep out the dreams. I woke several times in the night, my heart racing, my hands shaking, the walls of the sod house pressing in around me. The tremors were worse now, and the sweating had started—I could feel the dampness on my skin despite the chill air.

I knew what was happening. The whiskey was nearly gone, and my body was beginning to protest its absence. Another day, maybe two, and the real symptoms would begin. The visions. The terror. The sense that the world was coming apart at the seams.

I had one drink left. I saved it for morning.

---

When the gray light of dawn began to seep through the window, I rose and went outside.

The graves were still there. They had not been a dream.

I stood at the edge of the little plot where they lay, two low mounds covered in snow, each one marked by a cairn of stones. In the daylight I could see them more clearly than I had the night before. Someone had taken care with them—the stones were placed deliberately, forming rough rectangles over each grave, keeping the snow and the scavengers from the bodies beneath.

Two graves. The trader had said there were two Hardins, a man and a wife. That matched what I saw. Husband and wife, buried side by side on the land they had tried to make their home.

I walked around the graves, looking for any sign of who had dug them. The ground was frozen now, had been frozen for months, but the digging would have been done earlier—late summer, perhaps, or early fall, when the earth was still soft enough to turn. Whoever had done it had been thorough. The graves were deep enough that the stones lay flat, not mounded up as they would have been over a shallow burial.

I thought about George Hardin, the man I had been sent to find. If he had killed his wife, would he have buried her like this? Carefully, deliberately, with stones placed just so?

Perhaps. Men did strange things when guilt took hold of them. But something felt wrong about it. The care taken here did not match the violence that must have preceded it.

I went back inside and searched the house more thoroughly.

---

The signs of violence were there, once you knew what to look for.

A dark stain on the floorboards near the door, scrubbed but not entirely removed. A crack in the wall where something had struck it with force. A chair with a broken leg, propped in the corner as if someone had meant to repair it and never gotten around to it.

I found blood on the bedframe too, a smear of it on the wooden post at the foot. And on the table, beneath the dust, faint traces of something that had been wiped away but not erased entirely.

Someone had tried to clean up after what happened here. Someone had taken the time to scrub the floors and wipe the furniture and make the place look almost normal. But they had not been able to remove everything. The violence had soaked into the bones of this place, and it remained.

I stood in the center of the room and tried to piece together what had happened.

A struggle near the door—that was where it started, most likely. The man of the house, George Hardin, coming to answer a knock or confronting someone who had entered uninvited. The crack in the wall, the broken chair, the blood on the floor. Then something at the bed—the woman, Catherine, awakened by the noise, caught before she could flee or defend herself.

Two graves. Two victims. One killer.

I did not know who had done this, not from what I could see here. The story was incomplete, the evidence partial. I was reading a book with pages torn out.

---

I searched the outbuildings next.

The barn was small, barely large enough for a horse and a cow, and it was empty now. Whatever animals the Hardins had kept were gone—stolen, perhaps, or simply wandered off after their owners died. The hay in the loft was old and dry, undisturbed since the previous summer.

There was blood here too. A splash of it on the doorframe, another smear on the packed earth floor. George Hardin, I guessed. He had been in the barn when it happened, had tried to fight or flee, had failed.

I went around to the back of the barn, to where the graves lay.

In the daylight I could see something I had missed the night before. Near the head of the nearest grave, half-buried in the snow, there was a piece of paper.

I knelt and brushed the snow away.

It was a page torn from a journal or notebook, the paper thick and yellowed. It had been placed deliberately, I could see now—weighted with a small stone, positioned as if it were meant to be found. But the paper was stained, dark marks obscuring most of what had been written there.

Blood. The page had been used to soak up blood—from the burials, I thought, from the handling of the bodies. Whoever had placed it here had done so after using it for that grim purpose.

I picked it up carefully and turned it toward the light.

Most of the writing was illegible, obscured by the dark stains. But a few words remained visible, scattered across the page like survivors of a shipwreck.

*...the white buffalo...*

*...necessary...*

*...I am sorry for...*

The handwriting was neat, almost formal—the hand of someone who had learned to write carefully, who took pride in the forming of letters. Not the hand of George Hardin, I thought, though I had nothing to compare it to. Not the hand of a farmer.

I read the visible words again. *The white buffalo. Necessary. I am sorry for.*

The man who followed the white buffalo. The one the trapper had seen, and the mail carrier, and the trader. The one who walked behind the sacred animal like a dog following its master, his eyes empty, his soul already gone.

He had been here. He had done this.

I did not know why. The words on the page offered no explanation—*necessary* was not an explanation, *sorry* was not an explanation. But I knew, with a certainty I could not have defended, that the man who followed the white buffalo had killed the Hardins and buried them behind their barn and left this page as a marker or a confession or a prayer.

I folded the page and put it in my pocket.

---

I stood by the graves for a long time, thinking.

I had what I came for. I had the answer Aldridge had sent me to find. His daughter was dead, and her husband with her, and the man who killed them was not George Hardin but someone else entirely—a stranger, a madman, a man with a white buffalo and empty eyes.

I could turn back now. I could ride south to the trading post, then east to Fort Kearny, then back along the trails I had traveled to reach this place. I could find Aldridge in Oswego and tell him what I had found. His daughter is dead, I would say. She did not suffer at her husband's hand. They died together, killed by a man who killed without reason, and they are buried together on the land they tried to make their home.

It would be enough. It would be the truth, or close enough to it.

But I did not turn back.

I told myself it was because the job was not finished. Aldridge had hired me to deal with whoever had killed his daughter, and the killer was still out there, following his white buffalo across the frozen plains. The money in my pocket was half of what I had been promised, and the other half depended on completing what I had started.

But that was not the real reason.

The real reason was simpler and stranger. I wanted to see him. The man who followed the white buffalo. The man with the empty eyes and the blood on his hands. I wanted to find him and look at him and understand what he was.

I had known men like him, or thought I had. In Mexico, during the war, I had seen what happened to men who lost something essential inside themselves. The ones who kept fighting after the fear had burned away, who killed without hesitation and slept without dreaming, who moved through the world like ghosts wearing the shapes of men.

I had been one of them, for a time. I had felt the emptiness they felt, had done the things they did. And then the war had ended and I had come back, or tried to come back, and I had spent the years since trying to fill the space that the war had hollowed out.

The man who followed the white buffalo had not come back. He was still out there, still empty, still moving toward something I did not understand.

I wanted to see where he was going. I wanted to know how the story ended.

---

I spent one more night in the Hardins' house.

I finished the last of my whiskey that evening, drinking it slowly, trying to make it last. The tremors in my hands were constant now, and I could feel the pressure building behind my eyes—the first signs of what was coming.

I slept badly, woke often, dreamed of things I could not remember. At one point I thought I heard voices outside the house, and I lay in the darkness listening, my hand on my rifle, until I realized there was nothing there. Just the wind. Just the ghosts of the people who had lived here.

In the morning I saddled my horse, closed the door of the sod house behind me, and rode north.

The man who followed the white buffalo was out there somewhere, in the frozen emptiness beyond the last homestead. The stories I had heard all agreed on that. He was moving, as he had been moving for years, following his sacred animal across the plains.

I would find him. I did not know what I would do when I did—whether I would kill him, as Aldridge expected, or simply look at him and try to understand what I was seeing. But I would find him.

The trail was there, buried under the snow but still visible to someone who knew how to look. The track of a large animal, moving north. The smaller track of a man, following behind.

I followed them both.
