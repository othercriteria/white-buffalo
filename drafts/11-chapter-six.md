# Chapter Six

The creek the trader had described was easy enough to find. It came down from the north through a narrow valley, its banks lined with willows that had turned brown and brittle in the cold. The ice on its surface was cloudy, thick enough to walk on, and I could see where deer or antelope had crossed it, their hoofprints frozen into the snow on either side.

I turned up the creek and followed it north.

The country here was rougher than the river valley—broken hills and shallow draws, patches of pine on the northern slopes where the sun could not reach. The wind was less fierce, blocked by the terrain, but the cold was no less bitter. My breath froze in my beard, and the horse's breath hung in the air behind us like a trailing ghost.

I had been riding for nearly a month now. December had come and was half-gone, and I had not spoken to another person since leaving the trading post. The silence of the country had seeped into me, filling the spaces where conversation used to be.

Christmas would come soon. I had not thought about Christmas in years—had no reason to, no family to celebrate with, no traditions to observe. But out here, in the empty white, I found myself counting the days nonetheless. December twenty-fifth would pass like any other day, unmarked, unremarked. I would ride and camp and ride again, and the year would turn without ceremony.

It did not trouble me. Very little troubled me anymore.

The whiskey was running low.

I had rationed carefully since leaving the trading post, measuring my drinks by the swallow rather than the cup, but even so the bottles were emptying faster than I had hoped. Two were gone entirely, their glass discarded along the trail. The third was perhaps a quarter full.

I knew what would happen when it ran out. I had seen it before, in other men and in myself. The shaking would start first—a tremor in the hands that spread to the arms, the legs, the whole body. Then the sweating, even in the cold. Then the sleeplessness, the racing heart, the visions.

The visions were the worst part. I had heard men describe them—snakes crawling on the walls, insects covering the floor, faces appearing in the corners of the room. I had experienced them myself, once, years ago, when a winter storm had trapped me without supply for too long. I had seen things that night that I did not like to remember.

I did not want to go through that again. But the territory was empty, and the nearest place I might find whiskey was days behind me, and I was not going to turn back now. I was too close.

So I rationed, and I counted the swallows that remained, and I tried not to think about what would happen when they were gone.

The first symptoms came on the third day up the creek.

I noticed the tremor first, a slight unsteadiness in my hands as I saddled the horse in the morning. I told myself it was the cold, but I knew better. The cold made your hands clumsy, made your fingers slow. It did not make them shake.

That night I slept badly. I woke several times from dreams I could not remember, my heart pounding, my skin damp despite the freezing air. The horse was restless too, shifting and snorting in the darkness, as if he could sense something wrong.

I had perhaps two days' worth of whiskey left. Maybe three, if I was careful.

I was not going to be careful.

I took a long drink and felt the warmth spread through my chest, felt the tremor in my hands ease, felt the knot of anxiety in my gut begin to loosen. The relief was immediate and profound, and I knew that it would not last—that each time I drank the relief would be shorter, the return of symptoms faster, until there was nothing left to drink and the real trouble began.

But that was tomorrow's problem. Tonight, I had whiskey, and I had warmth, and I had the knowledge that I was close.

The Hardins' homestead was not far now. A day's ride, maybe less.

I would find what I had come to find, and then I would deal with whatever came next.

---

I found the homestead on the afternoon of the fourth day.

The creek made a bend around a low hill, and as I came around it I saw the sod house sitting in a small clearing perhaps a hundred yards ahead. It was a crude structure, smaller than the trading post, built of the same blocks of cut earth that passed for building material in this country. A barn—if you could call it that, a lean-to shelter barely large enough for a horse and a cow—stood behind it. A well had been dug near the front, a wooden frame above it to hold a pulley and rope. A small patch of ground, now buried under snow, marked where someone had tried to plant a garden.

The place looked abandoned.

No smoke rose from the chimney. No light showed in the single small window. No tracks disturbed the snow around the door—not fresh ones, anyway. Whatever footprints had been made here had been filled in by subsequent snows, leaving only vague depressions that might have been anything.

I sat on my horse at the edge of the clearing and studied the place. The silence was complete. No sound of animals, no creak of timber, nothing but the wind whispering across the snow.

"Hello," I called. My voice sounded strange in my own ears, rough from disuse. "Anyone here?"

No answer.

I rode closer, slowly, keeping my hand near the rifle in its scabbard. The horse's hooves crunched in the snow, the only sound in the white world.

The front door of the sod house was closed but not barred. I could see that from ten feet away—the simple wooden latch was in the up position, holding the door shut but not locked. Anyone could have opened it. Anyone could have gone in.

Or come out.

I dismounted and tied the horse to the well frame. My legs were stiff from the cold and the long ride, and I stumbled slightly as I walked toward the door. The tremor in my hands was back, worse than before.

I pushed the door open.

The interior was dark, lit only by the gray light filtering through the small window. The smell hit me first—a stale, closed-up smell, the smell of a place that had been empty for months. No cooking, no fire, no human presence.

I stood in the doorway and let my eyes adjust.

A table and two chairs. A bed against the far wall, the blankets neatly made. A cast-iron stove, cold, its pipe rising through the sod roof. Shelves along one wall holding dishes, a few books, the accumulated necessities of a frontier life. A woman's dress hanging from a peg near the door, next to a man's coat.

Two chairs. One bed. No cradle, no child's things, nothing to suggest that anyone but a man and a woman had lived here. The letters had been silent on this point, and the house confirmed the silence.

Everything in its place. Everything orderly. As if the people who lived here had simply stepped out for a moment and not returned.

But the dust on the table was thick, and the cold inside was the same as the cold outside, and the blankets on the bed had not been slept in for a very long time.

I stepped inside and closed the door behind me.

---

The search did not take long. The house was small, and there was not much to find.

The books on the shelf were what you would expect—a Bible, a farmer's almanac from 1856, a novel that had been popular back East. The dishes were plain but serviceable. The clothes—his and hers—hung neatly, waiting for owners who would not return.

I found letters in a small wooden box on the shelf. Some of them were addressed to Catherine Hardin in a hand I recognized—her father's, no doubt, careful and precise. Some were drafts of letters she had written back, the paper covered with her own hand, the words crossing out and rewriting as she tried to say what she wanted to say.

I read one of them. *Dear Father,* it began. *I know you worry about me, and I wish I could set your mind at ease. The truth is that I worry too, sometimes, when the wind blows and the nights are long and George is gone checking on the stock. But then the sun rises and the land is beautiful and I remember why we came here. We are building something, Father. Something that will last. I have to believe that.*

The letter was unfinished. It broke off in the middle of a sentence about the coming winter and the preparations they were making.

I put it back in the box and continued searching.

There was food in the pantry—dried beans and flour and salt pork, the supplies that would keep through a winter. There was firewood stacked beside the stove, enough for a week or more. Grain for animals in the barn. A root cellar dug into the hillside behind the house, its door frozen shut but intact.

They had been ready. That was the thing I could not stop thinking about as I stood in that cold room. They had done everything right—built the house, dug the well, laid in stores against the cold. They had prepared for the worst the land could offer, and the land had not killed them. Something else had.

Everything a family would need to survive the season. Everything except the family.

I went back outside. The light was fading, the short winter day already ending. I walked around the house, looking for anything I might have missed.

Behind the barn, I found the graves.

Two of them, side by side, covered in snow but still visible as low mounds in the flat ground. Someone had piled rocks on top of each one—to keep the animals away, I supposed, or perhaps just to mark the spot. There were no crosses, no headstones, nothing to indicate who lay beneath.

I stood there for a long time, looking at the graves, while the light failed and the cold deepened and the stars began to appear in the darkening sky.

Then I went back inside, built a fire in the stove, and waited for morning.

In the night I heard the ice on the creek behind the house. It made sounds I had not expected—groans and cracks and sometimes a noise like something heavy being dragged across a wooden floor. The creek was freezing deeper, the ice thickening, and each expansion and contraction sent vibrations through the ground that I could feel in my bones. The dead slept under that sound, I thought. The Hardins, buried behind their barn, listened to the ice every night, and would go on listening until spring came and the water ran free again.
