# Journal Entry IV

*November the Fourteenth, Eighteen Fifty-Six*

The first real snow came last night. I woke to find myself buried in it, only my face exposed, my breath making a small cave in the white. The herd had moved to shelter in a draw a quarter mile away. I could see them from where I lay, dark shapes against the snow, their breath rising in clouds.

I found her among them. Still white. Still visible. Still alive.

I dug myself out and walked to where I could watch them better. The cold was severe, worse than anything I had felt in Virginia or Mexico. My fingers ached inside my gloves. My face burned where the wind touched it.

This is the winter that will test us both.

*November the Twenty-Ninth*

No entry for two weeks. The cold has made writing difficult. My fingers do not work as they should.

The herd has moved south, seeking grass beneath the snow. I follow. Some days I can barely keep pace. My food is nearly gone. I have been eating what the wolves leave, when I can find it before the crows do.

She endures. The herd endures. I endure because I must.

*December the Eleventh*

Found a buffalo carcass today, frozen solid. Wolves had been at it, but there was meat left. I hacked off what I could carry with my knife and ate it raw. The blood froze on my beard before I could wipe it away.

The herd is still moving. She is still with them. That is all that matters.

*December the Twenty-Fifth*

Christmas Day. I had almost forgotten.

I am sheltering in a hollow in the bluffs, out of the wind. The snow is four feet deep on level ground, deeper in the drifts. The herd has stopped moving, clustered together in a broad valley where the snow has been beaten down by their hooves. They stand with their great heads lowered, their breath steaming, waiting for the cold to break.

I can see her from here. She stands near the center of the herd, surrounded by other animals, protected by their mass. Even in the depths of winter, she glows.

I wonder what my family would think if they could see me now. My father is dead—died the year I enlisted, though I did not learn of it until after the war. My mother may still be living, in the house where I was born, in the valley where I grew up. I have not written to her in years. I do not know if she thinks of me, or what she thinks.

It does not matter. That life is over. This is the life I have now.

*January the Third, Eighteen Fifty-Seven*

Saw Indians today. Three of them, on horseback, watching from a ridge perhaps half a mile away. Lakota, I think, by their dress and the way they sat their horses.

They watched for a long time. I did not move. The herd did not move. She did not move.

Then they turned and rode north, and I did not see them again.

I wonder what they think of me. I wonder if they know what the white buffalo means. They must. It is their story, their prophecy, their sacred thing. And here I am, a white man, following it across their land, waiting for it to kill me.

Perhaps they think I am mad. Perhaps they are right.

*January the Nineteenth*

The cold is a living thing. It has a weight, a presence. It presses against you from all sides, squeezing the warmth out of your body, the life out of your limbs. At night, when the wind dies and the stars come out, you can hear it—a silence so deep it has a sound of its own, like the ringing in your ears after a cannon blast.

I have stopped feeling my feet. I have stopped feeling my hands. I move because I must move, because if I stop moving I will die, and I am not ready to die. Not yet. Not like this.

She is still there. I saw her this morning, grazing at the edge of the herd, pawing through the snow to reach the dead grass beneath. She looked at me as I passed, and I thought I saw something in her eyes. Recognition, perhaps. Or pity.

I do not want her pity. I want her to kill me. But she is not ready, and so I am not ready, and so we both endure.

---

*February the Second*

The worst of the cold has broken. The snow is still deep, but the wind has shifted, coming now from the west instead of the north, and there is a softness in it that promises spring.

The herd has begun to move again, drifting north along the river valleys. I follow. My body has adapted to the cold, or perhaps simply given up protesting it. I no longer feel the pain I felt in December. I no longer feel much of anything.

She has grown through the winter. I had not thought that possible—I had assumed she would simply endure, as I have endured, waiting for the spring to bring growth and strength. But she is larger than she was in November. Her shoulders are broader, her hump more pronounced. She moves with a new confidence, a new power.

She is becoming what she needs to be. And I am becoming what I need to be—less than a man, something stripped down and simplified, something that exists only for this one purpose.

We are both almost ready.

*February the Fourteenth*

I have survived the winter.

I did not think I would. There were nights when I lay in the snow and watched my breath freeze in the air and thought: this is how it ends, not by her hooves but by the cold, not with meaning but with simple failure. But I woke each morning, and I found her each day, and I kept walking.

The herd is strong. She is strong. The spring will bring grass and warmth and the beginning of a new cycle.

And next winter, or the winter after, she will be ready.

I can wait.
