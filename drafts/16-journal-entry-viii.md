# Journal Entry VIII

*September the Third, Eighteen Fifty-Eight*

The summer has passed. The grass has begun to turn, the green fading to brown, the land preparing for the winter that will come. The herd is moving again, drifting south in the long slow patterns they have followed for ten thousand years.

She is with them. She is always with them.

And she is ready.

*September the Fifteenth*

I have been watching her these past weeks with a new kind of attention. Before, I watched to learn—to understand her movements, her habits, the rhythms of her life. Now I watch to assess. To measure. To know.

She is fully grown. I am certain of this now. Her body has reached its final form—the massive shoulders, the great humped back, the horns that have curved and thickened over the two years I have followed her. She stands taller than any cow in the herd, and she carries herself with a weight and presence that sets her apart even more than her color does.

When she walks, the ground trembles. When she runs, the thunder of her hooves drowns out all other sound. When she turns her head to look at something—a noise in the grass, a movement on the ridge—there is a terrible deliberation in the motion, a promise of violence held in check.

She could kill me now. She could kill any man who stood before her.

But she will not. Not unless I make her.

*September the Twenty-Eighth*

I have been thinking about how to do this.

It seems strange, after all this time, that the mechanics of the thing should occupy my mind. I have thought about little else for two years—about her, about my death, about the meaning I hope to find in the intersection of the two. But I have not thought carefully about how, exactly, it will happen. I have assumed that when the time came, the way would be clear.

It is not clear. That is what I am beginning to understand.

She does not fear me. That much is obvious. I have followed her for two years, watched her from a distance, spoken to her across the empty grass—and in all that time she has never shown the slightest sign of alarm at my presence. I am part of her world now, as familiar to her as the other buffalo, as the grass, as the sky.

If I simply approach her—walk toward her across the meadow, stand before her and wait—she will not attack. She will watch me, perhaps. She will wonder, in whatever way a buffalo wonders, what I am doing. But she will not charge. She will not lower her head and strike.

I need to frighten her. Or anger her. I need to provoke the instinct that will make her see me not as a familiar presence but as a threat.

I am not sure how to do this. But I will find a way.

*October the Twelfth*

The Lakota have been watching me.

I have seen them several times over the past weeks—small groups of riders on the ridges, watching from a distance, never approaching. They know what she is. They have known since before I found her. And they are waiting to see what I will do.

I wonder what they think of me. This strange white man who follows the sacred animal, who lives like an animal himself, who seems to have no purpose but to be near her. Do they think I am mad? Do they think I am some kind of holy fool, touched by the spirits, pursuing a vision they cannot understand?

Or do they know? Do they see what I see—that I am waiting to die, that she is the instrument of my death, that everything I have done these past two years has been in preparation for the moment when she ends me?

Perhaps they do. Perhaps that is why they watch but do not interfere.

---

*October the Twenty-Sixth*

I have decided what I will do.

I will approach her at dawn, when the light is pale and the air is cold and the herd is still drowsy from the night. I will walk toward her slowly, giving her time to see me, to understand that something is different. And then, when I am close enough, I will run.

I will run at her, shouting, waving my arms, doing everything I can to seem like a threat. I will force her to react, to choose between flight and fight. And because she is what she is—proud, powerful, sacred—she will choose fight.

She will lower her head and charge. She will strike me with those horns, those hooves, that thousand pounds of muscle and bone. And I will die.

It is not a complicated plan. It does not need to be. What matters is not the how but the what—the death itself, the meaning I will find in it, the end I have been seeking since I first walked out onto these plains.

*November the Eighth*

The cold has come again. The third winter I will spend in her company, though I do not expect to see the spring.

The herd has settled into a valley north of the river, a sheltered place where the wind cannot reach and the snow does not drift so deep. She is with them, standing apart as she always does, her white coat bright against the brown of the dead grass.

I watch her from the ridge above. I have watched her from this same spot for three days now, waiting for the right moment, the right conditions. I need clear weather—not for my sake, but so that she can see me clearly when I make my approach. I need calm—so that my movements are not masked by wind or noise. I need everything to be perfect.

I have waited two years. I can wait a little longer.

---

*November the Twentieth*

Soon.

The weather has cleared. The wind has died. The herd is settled, grazing peacefully in the valley, undisturbed by predators or storms or any of the dangers that haunt the plains.

She stands at the edge of the herd, alone, facing north. She has been standing like that for most of the morning, as if waiting for something. As if she knows what is coming.

Perhaps she does. Perhaps she has always known.

Tomorrow, I think. Tomorrow, when the sun rises, I will walk down from this ridge. I will cross the meadow where I have watched her for so long. I will approach her, and I will make her see me as a threat, and she will do what she was made to do.

I am not afraid. I thought I might be, at the end—thought that the instinct for survival might overwhelm the purpose I have carried for so long. But there is no fear. There is only a great and quiet peace, a sense that everything is finally as it should be.

I will write one more entry, after tomorrow. If I am able.

If not, then this is the end of my account. To whoever reads these words: I do not ask for understanding. I do not ask for forgiveness. I ask only that you believe me when I tell you that I am going to my death willingly, gladly, with the certainty that it is the only right thing I have ever done.

The white buffalo is waiting for me. I will not make her wait much longer.
