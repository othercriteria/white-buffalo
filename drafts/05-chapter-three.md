# Chapter Three

I left Chicago on a gray morning with the smell of snow in the air. The horse was sound, the saddlebags packed, the bottles of whiskey cushioned among my clothes where they would not break. I had everything I needed and nothing I did not.

The road west followed the rail line for a while, then turned south toward the river. There were other travelers on it—farmers with their wagons, merchants with their goods, occasional riders like myself. We nodded to each other in passing but did not stop to talk. Everyone was moving too fast for conversation, trying to get where they were going before winter closed the roads.

By midday I had left the city behind. The country opened up, flat and wide, the horizon a straight line where the brown fields met the gray sky. Farm houses dotted the landscape, set far apart, their chimneys trailing smoke. The crops had been harvested and the fields were stubble, waiting for the snow.

I rode until dark and made camp in a stand of oaks near a creek. The fire was small—I did not want company—but it was enough to heat water for coffee and warm my hands. The horse grazed on the dead grass at the edge of the trees, his breath steaming in the cold air.

I ate dried meat and hardtack and had a drink from the bottle. The whiskey burned going down, then settled into a warmth that spread through my chest. One drink became two. Two became three. I stopped there, not because I wanted to but because I needed the supply to last.

The night was quiet except for the wind and the occasional call of an owl somewhere in the dark. I wrapped myself in my blankets and lay close to the fire and thought about nothing in particular.

---

The next days blurred together. I rode from dawn to dusk, stopping only to rest the horse and to eat and drink. The country did not change—flat fields, bare trees, distant farmhouses. The sky stayed gray, threatening snow that did not come.

On the fourth day I reached the Mississippi.

I had seen the river before, years ago, but it still surprised me. The sheer width of it, the dark water moving with a power that suggested depths I could not imagine. The far shore was visible but distant, a line of trees at the edge of the world.

The ferry was a flat-bottomed boat large enough for a dozen horses and twice as many men. The ferryman was a thick-bodied man with a face like weathered stone and hands that looked strong enough to strangle a bear. He took my money without comment and waved me aboard.

There were others waiting to cross—a family in a wagon, a merchant with a string of pack mules, two men on horseback who had the look of brothers. We stood on the deck as the ferryman and his crew worked the ropes and the boat began its slow journey across.

The brothers were talking. I did not mean to listen, but sound carried on the water, and they were not trying to be quiet.

"You hear about McCrea?" the older one said.

"Which one?"

"The one had the mill outside Osawatomie. They burned it last month. Him and his boy both."

"Christ." The younger brother spat over the side of the boat. "He pick a side, or just in the way?"

"Does it matter anymore?"

They were quiet for a moment. The water slapped against the hull.

"Jim says he's not going back," the younger one said. "Says he's done with the whole territory. Going to try California."

"Jim's smart. Whole country's going to hell. You watch."

I watched the far shore grow closer. Kansas had been bleeding for years now, and the bleeding had started to spread. I had stopped reading the newspapers—the names and places blurred together after a while, one killing much like another—but you could not travel west without hearing the talk.

I had served under men who would lead that war, when it came. I had seen what they were capable of. Zachary Taylor was dead now, president for a year and then gone, but there were others still living. Jefferson Davis, who had commanded the Mississippi Rifles at Buena Vista and now sat in the Senate speaking of states' rights and the honor of the South. Robert Lee, who had been an engineer in Mexico and was now superintending West Point. A dozen others, majors and colonels then, who would be generals when the time came.

I had seen them at Monterrey, ordering men forward into streets where Mexican guns waited at every window. I had seen them at Chapultepec, watching as their soldiers climbed walls that were designed to be unclimbable. They were capable men. They were men who understood that war was mathematics—so many lives spent for so many yards gained—and who could do the arithmetic without flinching.

When they turned that arithmetic on each other, the whole country would burn. The brothers were right about that.

The boat reached the far shore and we disembarked, the horses stepping carefully onto the wooden dock. I paid the ferryman and rode on without looking back.

Iowa was more of the same—flat land, bare trees, farms scattered across the emptiness. But there was something different about it too, a wildness at the edges that had not been present in Illinois. The farms were newer, cruder, the houses made of sod as often as wood. The people I passed had a look about them, a watchfulness that suggested they had not forgotten what it meant to live at the edge of the settled world.

I stopped for a night in a small town whose name I did not catch. There was a tavern that served food and rented rooms, and I took both. The food was bad and the room was worse, but there was whiskey, which was what mattered.

The tavern was half-full, men from the surrounding farms come to drink and talk and escape the silence of their land. I sat in a corner and listened to their conversation, which was mostly about the weather and the harvest and the price of grain. But occasionally it turned to other things.

"You hear about the trouble up north?" one man asked. "Some Indian band raiding settlers near Spirit Lake."

"Sioux?"

"Santee, they say. Killed a whole family, women and children both."

"That was years ago. They caught the ones who did it."

"They caught some of them. The rest are still out there."

Another man shook his head. "The whole territory is going to hell. Between the Indians and the weather and the damn speculators buying up all the good land, a man can barely make a living."

"At least we're not in Kansas."

"Yet."

The conversation moved on. I finished my drink and went up to my room and lay on the bed without undressing. The ceiling was low, the walls thin. I could hear the men below, their voices rising and falling.

I thought about what I was riding toward. The Nebraska Territory was wilder than Iowa, emptier, more dangerous. The Sioux were there, and other tribes. The winters were worse. The law was whatever a man could make of it with his own two hands.

And somewhere in that emptiness, George and Catherine Hardin had tried to make a home. Somewhere in that emptiness, something had happened to them.

I would find out what. That was my job.

I reached Council Bluffs on the seventh day of my journey, riding into town as the sun was setting behind the bluffs that gave the place its name. It was the last significant settlement before the territories, a jumping-off point for everyone heading west.

The town was busy despite the season. Traders and trappers and settlers preparing for the final push, or else waiting out the winter before continuing in spring. There were soldiers too—a small detachment from Fort Kearny, I gathered, come to resupply.

I found a livery stable where I could board my horse, then found a hotel where I could board myself. The room was small but clean, the bed narrow but soft enough. I paid for three nights, not knowing how long I would need to stay.

That evening I went out to see what could be learned.

The saloons were full of men who knew the territory, or claimed to. I bought drinks and listened and occasionally asked questions. Yes, there were homesteaders on the Niobrara. Not many—the country was hard and the Indians were a problem—but some. No, no one knew the Hardins specifically. There were a lot of homesteaders, and they did not come to town often, and the territory was large.

I asked about the route. Up the Platte, they said, following the emigrant trail toward Fort Kearny. Then north, into the sand hills, into the emptiness. It would be hard going in winter. A man could die out there, alone, if he was not careful.

I thanked them for the advice and bought another round and continued listening.

And then I heard something else.

"You hear about the man and the white buffalo?" someone said. He was drunk, his words slurring, but there was something in his voice that made me pay attention.

"The what?"

"The man who follows the white buffalo. Out on the plains, north of here. People have seen him."

"People see a lot of things when they've been drinking."

"No, I'm telling you, this is real. Trapper named McCulloch came through last month, said he saw them. A white buffalo—pure white, like snow—and a man following it. Just walking along behind it, like a dog following its master."

"That's the craziest thing I ever heard."

"I'm just telling you what McCulloch said. Said the man looked half-dead, thin as a rail, beard down to his chest. Said he didn't try to talk to him. Said there was something in the man's eyes that made him think he'd better not."

The conversation moved on, but I did not stop thinking about it.

A man who followed a white buffalo. It meant nothing to me, not then. Just another strange story from a strange country.

But I remembered it. I would have cause to remember it later.

---

I stayed in Council Bluffs for two more days, buying supplies and asking questions. No one knew anything useful about the Hardins. The territory was too large, too empty, too unknown.

On the third morning I packed my things and saddled my horse and rode out of town, following the trail that led along the Platte River into the west.

The sky was gray, heavy with the promise of snow. The wind was cold, blowing down from the north, carrying with it the smell of ice and distance. Winter was coming, and I was riding into it.

I did not look back.
