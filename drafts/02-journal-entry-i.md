# Journal Entry I

*April the Nineteenth, Eighteen Fifty-Six*

I have walked a long time. I do not know how long. The days blur together on the plains, each one the same as the last, the grass moving under the wind like the surface of a sea. I have lost count of the weeks. Perhaps months.

I came out here to die. I should write that down plainly so that whoever reads this will understand. I am not mad, though I know how this will sound. I came out here because I could not die in the places where men live, among their noise and their commerce and their endless small concerns. I needed a place large enough for what I intended.

I thought at first that the land itself would kill me. The winters here are terrible. I have seen men frozen solid where they sat, their eyes open, their hands still raised as if in conversation. I have seen storms roll in from the north with no warning, the sky turning from blue to black in the space of an hour, and I have thought: this is how it will happen. But the storms pass and I remain. I am difficult to kill. I learned this in Mexico, though I did not want to learn it.

I thought perhaps the Sioux would kill me. I have crossed their lands without permission, without weapons sufficient to defend myself. I have seen their camps from a distance, the smoke rising in the cold air, the horses moving on the hillsides. They have seen me too. But they do not approach. Perhaps they think me mad, and mad men are sacred to them, or perhaps they simply do not care. I am one man, alone, walking. I am not worth the trouble.

I thought perhaps hunger would kill me, or thirst, or simple exhaustion. But the land provides more than I expected. There are streams everywhere, running down from the hills, and the buffalo are so numerous that a man cannot walk a mile without seeing them. I do not hunt—I have no gun, only a knife—but the wolves hunt, and they leave enough behind that I can eat if I am willing to eat what they leave. I am willing.

So I walk, and I do not die.

Until today.

Today I saw her.

The herd was moving south along the creek bottom, perhaps two hundred animals, the cows and calves in the center and the bulls ranging out on the edges. I have seen many such herds. They barely acknowledge me now. I am part of the landscape to them, no more threatening than a rock or a tree.

I was sitting on a rise, watching them pass, when I saw the calf.

She was apart from the others, trailing behind the herd by perhaps fifty yards. At first I thought she was sick or injured, left behind by a mother who could not afford to wait. Then the sun shifted and I saw her clearly and I understood that she was neither.

She was white. Not pale, not cream-colored, not the faded tan of an old hide. White. Her coat was the color of snow, of bone, of the clouds that pile up over the mountains before a storm. She moved through the brown grass like a ghost, like something that did not belong to this world.

I have heard of white buffalo. The Indians hold them sacred. They believe a white buffalo calf woman brought them their most holy things, their pipe, their rituals. To kill one is the greatest of sins. To see one is a blessing or a curse, depending on who sees it and why.

I watched her move through the grass and I knew what I had been waiting for.

This is how I will die. This is how it must happen.

Not by storm or starvation or the arrows of men who have every right to kill me. By her. By this white creature that should not exist, that is sacred to everyone who sees her, that carries meaning in her blood and her bones and her impossible coat.

I stood up. The herd shifted, a few of the nearest cows lifting their heads to watch me. The white calf kept walking, following the others, not looking at me.

I could have run to her. I could have thrown myself in her path, forced her to trample me, ended it there on the creek bottom with the grass waving around us and the clouds moving overhead. For a moment I wanted to. For a moment the wanting was so strong that my legs trembled with it.

But I did not.

She is too small. She is only a calf, perhaps six months old. Her hooves are soft. Her weight is nothing. If I threw myself before her she would shy away, or she would step on me and I would be bruised but not broken. She could not kill me. Not yet.

I must wait.

This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do—harder because I am the one demanding it of myself. I have waited in the trenches before an assault, listening to the guns, knowing that in an hour I would be running toward men who wanted me dead. I have waited in hospital tents, watching men die around me, wondering if I would be next. I have waited for news that never came, for letters that were never written, for a God who never answered.

But I have never waited like this. I have never waited for something I wanted with every part of myself, something that stood before me in the flesh, something I could reach out and touch if I chose.

I did not touch her. I watched her walk away with the herd, her white coat growing smaller and smaller against the brown of the land, until she was gone.

Tonight I am camped on the same rise where I sat and watched her. The fire is small—I have little to burn—but it is enough. I am writing by its light, writing in this book I have carried since I left, writing because I do not know what else to do.

Tomorrow I will follow the herd. I will find her again. I will watch her grow.

She will take a year, perhaps two, to reach her full size. The bulls are enormous, a thousand pounds or more, and even the cows can crush a man if they choose. I have seen what they can do. I have seen men gored and trampled, their bodies broken beyond recognition.

That is what I want. That is what I will wait for.

I do not know if I can explain why it must be this way. I do not fully understand it myself. But there is something right about it, something that fits the shape of what I have become. I was made into a killer in Mexico. I was made into something that should not exist. Now I will be unmade by something else that should not exist, something white and sacred and wild.

It is a kind of balance, I think. Or perhaps it is a kind of joke. I have never been certain which.

The fire is dying. I will sleep now, or try to.

In the morning, I will begin to follow her.
