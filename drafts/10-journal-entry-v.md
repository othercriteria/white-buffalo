*April the Fifth, Eighteen Fifty-Seven*

The snow is melting. The creeks are running high with the melt, cutting new channels through the meadows, carrying the winter away into the rivers and down to wherever rivers go. The grass is beginning to show in patches on the south-facing slopes—brown still, dead from the cold, but grass nonetheless. Soon it will be green, and the buffalo will feed, and she will grow.

She has survived her first year. I have survived alongside her.

*April the Twenty-Second*

The herd has broken apart for the spring, the bulls drifting off to form their own groups while the cows and young animals move together across the greening land. She stays with the cows, as I expected. She is not yet old enough to breed, and will not be for another year or more, but she seems to prefer their company to the bulls'.

I watch her from a distance, as I have always done. She knows I am here. I am certain of that now. When she grazes, she looks up sometimes and turns her head toward where I sit, and there is something in the motion that is more than animal wariness. She is keeping track of me, as I keep track of her.

We are bound together, she and I. Neither of us chose this, but both of us seem to accept it.

*May the Eighteenth*

She is beautiful in a way I did not expect.

I have watched her all winter, watched her through the worst of the cold and the deepest of the snow, and I thought I knew what she looked like. But I did not. The winter had hidden her true form beneath a coat thickened for survival, beneath a posture hunched against the cold. Now, in the warmth of late spring, she has emerged.

Her coat has thinned and brightened, white now with an almost silver sheen where the light catches it. Her muscles have grown—not just larger, but more defined, visible beneath the skin when she moves. Her shoulders are broad and powerful, her hump rising behind her neck like a monument. She is not yet full grown, but she is no longer small.

I watched her today as she crossed a creek, the water splashing up around her legs. She moved through it without hesitation, without care, as if the creek were an inconvenience so minor it did not warrant attention. The power in her movement was something to see. The certainty.

A year ago, she could not have killed me. Now she could. One charge, one blow of her head, and I would be done. I am certain of this now.

But I am not ready. And I do not think she is ready either. There is something unfinished between us, something that needs to grow as she has grown.

I will wait. I have learned how.

*June the Fourth*

Saw people today. The first I have seen since the Lakota in January.

They were far to the south, near the river, and at first I thought they were Indians. But they were not. They were white—a man and a woman, I think, though at that distance it was hard to be sure. They were working on something, building something. A house, perhaps, or a shelter. They had a wagon and some animals, and they moved with the purposeful energy of people who believe they are making something that will last.

I watched them for a long time. The herd was grazing in the valley below me, and she was with them, and the people were too far away to be any threat to either of us. But still I watched.

They do not know I am here. They do not know she is here. They are living their lives, building their house, planting their crops or tending their animals, and they have no idea what moves through the country around them.

I wonder if they will stay. Most of them don't. The land is too hard, the winters too long, the isolation too complete. They come with hope and leave with nothing, or they come with hope and die with nothing, and either way the land remains unchanged.

Perhaps these will be different. Perhaps they have what it takes to survive here.

Or perhaps not.

*July the Nineteenth*

She has begun to assert herself within the herd.

I noticed it first a week ago, when a young bull tried to approach her. He was not threatening—just curious, I think, drawn by her color or her smell or something else I could not perceive. But she did not want him near. She lowered her head and moved toward him, and he backed away.

She did not charge him. She did not need to. Her intention was clear, and he understood it.

Since then I have watched her more closely, and I have seen other signs. The other cows give her space. The calves do not play near her. Even the older bulls, when the herd re-forms for the seasonal movements, seem to treat her with a deference that goes beyond simple recognition.

She is becoming something more than a buffalo. Or perhaps she is becoming what she always was, and I am only now seeing it clearly.

*August the Second*

The homesteaders are still there. I passed near enough to see their progress yesterday, keeping to the ridges where I would not be seen. They have built a sod house—small, crude, but solid enough to survive a winter if they know what they are doing. They have plowed a field and planted something. They have dug a well.

The woman was outside when I watched, hanging clothes on a line strung between two posts. She was young, younger than I had expected. Her hair was dark, and the wind kept catching it and blowing it across her face, and she kept pushing it back with a gesture that looked habitual, practiced.

The man came out while I was watching. He said something to her that I could not hear, and she laughed, and he put his arm around her, and they stood together looking out at the land they had claimed.

I did not feel anything, watching them. I note this because I expected to feel something—envy, perhaps, or regret, or the ache of remembering what it was to be young and hopeful. But there was nothing. They were simply there, like the grass and the sky and the buffalo grazing in the valley below. Part of the landscape. Part of the world I was passing through on my way to somewhere else.

The herd is moving north again, following the grass. She is with them, and I am with her.

The homesteaders will stay or go. It does not concern me.

*August the Twenty-Third*

I am lighter now than I have ever been. Not just in body—I have been thin since the winter—but in everything. In thought, in feeling, in the weight of memory and regret that I have carried for so long.

I used to think about Mexico every day. The things I did, the things I saw, the man I became in those bloody months. Now I go days without thinking of it. When it does come to mind, it is distant, like something that happened to someone else, a story I heard once and half-forgot.

The man who killed seventeen men at Monterrey and Buena Vista and Chapultepec is still here, somewhere inside me. But he is quieter now. Smaller. Less important.

What is important is her. What is important is this: the waiting, the watching, the slow and patient progress toward the end I have chosen.

She is almost ready. I can see it in the way she moves, in the power that coils in her shoulders and haunches, in the confidence with which she faces the world. Another winter, perhaps, and she will be fully grown. Another winter, and this will be done.

I can wait.
