# Chapter Eleven

I found him where the valley opened into a wide meadow, lying in the snow beneath a sky the color of steel.

He was face-down, his arms spread wide, his body half-buried in the drift that had formed around him. The snow was disturbed for yards in every direction—churned up, trampled, painted with streaks of dark that I knew, even from a distance, was blood.

I dismounted and walked toward him. My legs did not want to work properly. The shaking had spread from my hands to my whole body, a constant tremor that made every step uncertain. The soldiers walked beside me, their blue coats bright against the white, their faces turned toward the man on the ground.

I knelt beside him and rolled him over.

His face was peaceful. That was the first thing I noticed—the absolute stillness of his features, the absence of pain or fear or anything else. His eyes were open, staring up at the gray sky, and there was something in them that might have been satisfaction. He had gotten what he wanted. The end he had sought for so long had finally come.

The rest of him was not so peaceful. His chest was crushed, the ribs staved in, the shape of his body wrong in ways that spoke of massive force. His coat was torn, his shirt beneath it shredded and dark with frozen blood. He had been trampled, gored, broken—killed by something with the weight and power to destroy a man completely.

I looked up.

She was there.

---

The white buffalo stood perhaps fifty yards away, watching me. Her coat was bright against the snow, white on white, but marked now with darker stains—blood, dried and frozen, crusted on her chest and forelegs. Her eyes were dark and liquid and utterly without expression.

She did not move. She did not make any sound. She simply stood there, massive and still, her breath steaming in the cold air.

I had my rifle. I could have raised it, sighted on her, put a bullet through her heart. She was close enough that I could not have missed. One shot, and the thing that had killed Josiah Morrow would be dead.

I did not raise the rifle.

I do not know why. Perhaps I was too tired. Perhaps I was too sick, too lost in the fog of withdrawal and fever and the visions that would not stop. Or perhaps I understood, in some way I could not articulate, that she was not my enemy. She had done what her nature demanded. She had killed a man who came at her with violence in his heart, who forced her to defend herself against a threat she could not understand.

She was innocent. As innocent as any wild thing can be. The guilt belonged to him, and to me, and to whatever forces had shaped us into what we were.

I sat back on my heels and looked at her. She looked back at me. And in that moment, I felt something I had not felt in longer than I could remember.

Peace.

---

The visions came again, but they were different now.

The soldiers were still there, standing in their silent circle, but they no longer seemed threatening. They were just men—dead men, men I had known, men I had fought beside and watched die. They had followed me all this way, and now they stood witness to whatever was happening here.

Catherine Hardin was there too. She stood beside the body of the man who had killed her, her face calm, her hands folded in front of her. She did not look at me. She was looking at the white buffalo, her expression one of wonder rather than fear.

And there were others now. People I did not recognize—a man and a woman, older, dressed in the clothes of an earlier time. The homesteader's parents, perhaps, or ancestors even more distant. They had come to see this ending, to watch the final act of a story that had begun long before I arrived.

I sat in the snow among the dead and the living and the things that were neither, and I watched the white buffalo watching me, and I felt the peace settle over me like a blanket.

It was not forgiveness. I had not earned forgiveness, and I did not expect it. But it was something. An acknowledgment, perhaps. A recognition that the long journey was over, that whatever happened next did not depend on me.

---

Time passed. I do not know how much.

The sun moved behind the clouds, invisible but present, its light changing from gray to paler gray to the first hints of gold. The wind picked up, then died away. The white buffalo stood where she had stood, motionless, patient.

And then she turned.

She turned away from me, slowly, deliberately, and began to walk. Not toward me, not away from me, but north—toward the ridges that rose at the edge of the valley, toward the country beyond.

I watched her go. Her white coat moved through the snow like a ship through water, and in the strange light of that winter morning she seemed to glow, to carry her own illumination, to be something more than animal and something less than divine.

She was halfway across the meadow when I saw the others.

They came from the north, three or four of them, appearing on the ridge like figures out of a dream. Men on horseback, dressed in furs and leather, their faces painted or simply weathered to the color of old copper. They sat their horses and watched as the white buffalo approached, and their expressions were impossible to read.

Lakota, I thought. Or perhaps not. Perhaps they were something else entirely—another vision, another gift from the fever that was burning through my mind, another impossible thing in a day full of impossible things.

The white buffalo reached them. They turned their horses, and she fell in among them, and together they began to move north, toward the ridges, toward the sacred places, toward wherever it was that sacred things went when their work was done.

I watched until they disappeared over the ridge. I watched until there was nothing left to watch—just the empty valley, and the body beside me, and the blood on the snow.

Then I lay back in the snow and closed my eyes and let the cold take me.

---

I do not remember what happened next.

There are fragments—a sensation of being lifted, of movement, of voices speaking in a language I did not understand. There is a memory of warmth, of fire, of something that might have been a face looking down at me. There is the taste of bitter liquid on my tongue, and the feeling of hands on my body, and a darkness that was not quite sleep and not quite death.

And then there is nothing.

The next thing I remember clearly is waking in a place I did not recognize, in a bed I had not seen before, with the sun coming through a window and a woman I did not know standing beside me.

But that is another story, and it does not belong here.

What belongs here is the valley. The body. The white buffalo and the men who led her away. The peace I felt as I lay in the snow, not knowing if I would live or die, not caring, simply existing in a moment that felt, for the first and only time in my life, like enough.

That is where this story ends. Not with answers, but with silence. Not with understanding, but with acceptance.

The white buffalo is gone. The man who followed her is dead. And I am still here, somehow, carrying the journal and the memories and the questions that will never be answered.

Perhaps that is enough.

Perhaps that is all any of us can hope for.
