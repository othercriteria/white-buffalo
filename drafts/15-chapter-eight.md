# Chapter Eight

The trail was there, but it was old.

The snow had fallen twice since whoever made these tracks had passed this way, filling in the prints, softening the edges, turning clear signs into vague suggestions. I followed what I could see—the faint depressions where hooves had struck the ground, the subtle differences in the texture of the snow where a large animal had walked. It was not easy. It required a kind of attention I found increasingly difficult to maintain.

The tremors were constant now.

I could not hold my hands steady enough to pour coffee from a pot, could not load my rifle without spilling powder, could not even grip the reins properly. My hands shook like leaves in a wind, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.

And the shaking was not the worst of it.

---

The visions had begun to come.

At first they were small things—shadows that moved at the edge of my sight, sounds that came from nowhere, a sense of being watched by something I could not see. I told myself it was the emptiness of the country playing tricks on my mind, the isolation working on my senses. I told myself I was fine.

Then I started seeing the men.

They were soldiers, most of them. Men in blue coats, men I had served with, men I had watched die in the streets of Monterrey and on the slopes of Chapultepec. They stood at the edges of my vision, watching me, their faces pale and still. When I turned to look at them directly, they were gone.

I knew they were not real. I knew my mind was producing them, feeding on the memories I had tried to bury, bringing them back now that the whiskey was no longer there to keep them down. But knowing did not make them go away.

They followed me as I followed the trail. They watched me as I made camp at night. They stood in circles around my fire, their dead eyes reflecting the flames, and they did not speak and they did not move and they did not leave.

I talked to them, sometimes. I could not help it. The silence was too complete, the isolation too profound, and the words came out of me whether I wanted them to or not.

"I'm sorry," I told them. "I'm sorry for what happened. I'm sorry I lived and you didn't."

They did not answer. They never answered.

---

I lost the trail on the third day.

A storm had come through the night before—not a blizzard, but a steady snow that had fallen for hours, covering everything in a fresh layer of white. When I woke in the morning—if you could call what I did sleeping—the tracks I had been following were gone.

I sat on my horse at the edge of a frozen creek and looked at the empty land around me. The country stretched away in all directions, white and gray and featureless. There were no landmarks I recognized, no signs of human passage, nothing to tell me where I was or where I should go.

I could turn back. The thought came to me clearly, cutting through the fog that had settled over my mind. I could turn back, retrace my steps, find the trading post and the river and the long road east. I could return to Aldridge with my report—*your daughter is dead, killed by a madman, buried in a cold grave at the edge of the world*—and collect my money and find a warm room and all the whiskey I could drink.

I could do that. No one would blame me. No one would even know.

But I did not turn back.

I do not know why. The reasons that had made sense before—the money, the job, the need to finish what I had started—seemed small and distant now, like things that belonged to someone else. What remained was something harder to name. A compulsion, perhaps. A need to see this through to whatever end was waiting.

Or perhaps it was simpler than that. Perhaps I was just tired of turning back.

---

I rode north.

It was not a decision exactly—more like an instinct, a pull I could not explain. The man who followed the white buffalo had been heading north when the trader saw him, north when the mail carrier passed him, north when the trapper watched him cross the frozen river. North was where the emptiest country lay, the land where no one lived, where a man could walk for days without seeing another soul.

If I were him—if I were a man seeking something I could not name, following something I could not explain—that is where I would go.

So I went north, into the white, into the silence, into whatever was waiting there.

---

The fourth day was the worst.

I woke before dawn to find that I could not move. My body was rigid, frozen in the blankets, every muscle locked tight. For a long moment I thought I was dead—thought I had finally succumbed to the cold and the exhaustion and the poison working its way out of my blood.

Then the shaking started.

It was not like the tremors I had felt before. This was something else—a full-body convulsion that seized me and would not let go, that rattled my teeth and wrenched my spine and left me gasping for air like a fish thrown up on the shore. It lasted for what felt like hours, though it was probably only minutes, and when it finally stopped I was lying in the snow outside my blankets, my face wet with sweat and tears.

I lay there for a long time, too weak to move, watching the sky lighten above me. The clouds were thin and gray, letting through a pale light that hurt my eyes. The wind was quiet. The world was silent.

I thought about dying. I thought about how easy it would be to simply stay where I was, to let the cold take me, to slip away into the white and never be found. It would be a clean death, a simple death, far better than I deserved.

But I did not die. Something in me would not allow it—some stubborn core that refused to give up, that had carried me through Mexico and through the years of drinking and through all the miles of empty country between here and the life I had left behind.

I got up. I saddled my horse. I rode on.

---

On the fifth day, I found the trail again.

It appeared suddenly, crossing my path at the bottom of a shallow draw—the tracks of a large animal, fresher than anything I had seen since leaving the homestead. The snow had not yet filled them in; the edges were still sharp, the depth still clear.

And beside them, sometimes overlapping, sometimes parallel, the smaller tracks of a man.

I dismounted and knelt beside the tracks, my hands shaking as I brushed the snow away. The buffalo tracks were deep, the weight of the animal pressing down into the frozen ground. The human tracks were lighter but clear—the print of worn boots, moving with a steady stride, never varying, never stopping.

He was close. A day ahead of me, maybe less.

I stood up and looked north, into the white. I could see nothing—no movement, no sign of life, just the endless roll of snow-covered hills stretching to the horizon. But I knew he was out there. I could feel it.

I mounted up and followed the tracks.

---

The horse was failing.

I had not wanted to see it, but by the afternoon I could no longer pretend otherwise. He was moving slowly, his head low, his steps heavy and uncertain. The deep snow was taking its toll—every step an effort, every yard a battle against the white that seemed to grip at his legs and hold him back.

I dismounted and led him for a while, breaking trail with my own body, but I was not much stronger than he was. The shaking in my hands had spread to my legs, and the world kept going gray at the edges, and sometimes I forgot what I was doing and stood there in the snow until the cold reminded me to move.

I tried to hunt. I saw a rabbit—just a flash of white against the snow, but I knew what it was—and I dismounted and loaded my rifle and stood there with the gun raised, waiting for it to move again.

My hands would not stop shaking. The barrel wavered, describing circles in the air, and even when I braced it against a tree I could not hold it steady. The rabbit moved, and I fired, and the shot went wide by a foot or more, and the rabbit vanished into the white as if it had never been.

I stood there for a long time, looking at the place where it had been, the smell of powder sharp in the cold air. I had perhaps two days of food left. The man I was following might have none.

We were alike in that too.

We stopped in a draw where the snow was shallower and the wind less fierce. The horse stood with his head down, breathing hard, his flanks dark with sweat despite the cold. I knew what that meant. A sweaty horse in winter is a dying horse, if you cannot get him dry.

I found a stand of cottonwood and stripped bark from the branches—sweet cottonwood, I hoped, though I could not be sure until he tried it—and I piled it in front of him and waited.

He ate. Not eagerly, but he ate, his teeth scraping the bark from the wood, his jaw working slowly. I watched him and felt something like hope.

"We rest here," I told him. "Until you can go on."

I made camp. I built a fire from the cottonwood and the deadfall I could gather, and I melted snow for water, and I ate the last of my bacon and most of my coffee. My supplies were running out. I had been too long on this trail, too many days in the white, and I had not planned for this.

In the morning the horse was better. Not well—he would not be well until he had rest and food and shelter, none of which I could give him—but better. He ate more bark, and drank the water I melted for him, and when I saddled him he stood steady under my weight.

"One more day," I said. "Just one more. Then we'll find him, and this will be over."

I did not know what "over" meant. I did not let myself think about it.

We went on.

---

The visions came back that night, worse than before.

I made camp in a hollow between two ridges, building a small fire from the dead wood I had gathered along the way. The flames flickered and danced, casting shadows on the snow, and in those shadows I saw faces. My father, dead these twenty years. My mother, whom I had not seen since before the war. The men I had killed, in Mexico and after—their eyes watching me, their mouths moving without sound.

And others. People I did not recognize, strangers who seemed to know me, who looked at me with a mixture of pity and accusation that I could not understand.

"Who are you?" I asked them. "What do you want?"

They did not answer. They never answered.

I sat by the fire and shook and sweated and watched the dead watch me, and eventually, without meaning to, I slept.

---

The dream was different from the others.

I was in Mexico, in a village I recognized—a place we had passed through during the march to Mexico City. The streets were empty, the houses shuttered, the people gone or hiding. I walked alone, my rifle in my hands, my boots echoing on the cobblestones.

At the end of the street there was a white buffalo.

She stood in the middle of the road, enormous, impossible, her coat bright against the brown of the buildings around her. She watched me with eyes that were not the eyes of an animal—dark and deep and full of something I could not name.

"I'm looking for a man," I said. "A man who follows you."

She did not answer. But she turned, slowly, and began to walk. And I followed her, down the empty street, into the darkness beyond.

I woke to gray light and frozen breath and the knowledge that I was closer than I had ever been.
