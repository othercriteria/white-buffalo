# Chapter Four

The Platte River corridor was the main road west, and even in early December it was not empty. I passed emigrants who had started too late and were now racing the snow, their wagons heavy with belongings they would have to abandon before spring. I passed traders heading back to the settlements with their season's profits, their pack mules laden with furs. I passed soldiers in blue coats riding in pairs and threes, their faces blank with the particular boredom of men who have been posted too far from anything that matters.

The country was flat and wide and gray. The river ran brown between its banks, low after the dry autumn, its islands of sand and gravel exposed like the bones of the land. The trees along its banks were bare, their branches dark against the sky. Snow lay in patches on the northern slopes of the low hills, and the wind that came down from the north had teeth in it.

I rode steady, making fifteen miles a day when the weather held, less when it didn't. The horse was sound—Hennessey had not cheated me there—and I had learned to read his moods well enough to know when to push and when to rest. We understood each other, the horse and I. Neither of us was in this for pleasure.

At night I made camp wherever I could find shelter—a stand of cottonwoods, a hollow in the hills, the lee side of an abandoned sod house. I built small fires and cooked what I had and drank from my supply, which was holding but not increasing. I would need to resupply soon. Fort Kearny was ahead, and there would be whiskey there, or something close enough.

The first week passed without incident. The second began the same way.

---

On the third day of the second week, I came upon a wagon that had broken an axle.

It was a heavy farm wagon, the kind emigrants used to haul their possessions west, and it had come to grief in a shallow draw where a creek crossed the trail. One rear wheel had dropped into a hole hidden by snow, and the axle had snapped under the weight. The wagon now sat at an angle, its contents spilling out onto the frozen ground.

The owner was a man named Gunderson—a Swede, by his accent—and he was standing beside the wreckage with the expression of a man who has just realized that his life has taken a turn he did not expect. His wife sat on a trunk nearby, wrapped in a blanket, her face pale. Two children, a boy and a girl of perhaps six and eight, were collecting scattered belongings from the snow.

"Bad luck," I said.

Gunderson looked up at me. His eyes were tired. "Ja. Bad luck. You have an axle? Trade maybe?"

"No."

He nodded, unsurprised. "No one has. Checked already. Three wagons passed this morning, no one has."

I looked at the wagon, at the broken axle, at the contents strewn across the ground. They had the usual assortment—pots and pans, bedding, tools, a plow blade that had probably cost half what they had. Nothing that would help with a broken axle.

"How far back is the last settlement?"

"Two days. Maybe three. Depends on the snow."

I did the calculation in my head. Two days back, however long it took to find or make an axle, two days forward again. A week, at least, more likely ten days. By then the snow would be deeper and the cold would be worse and the trip would be harder.

"You can't stay here," I said.

"I know."

"You have family at the other end? Someone waiting?"

Gunderson shook his head. "We were going to find land. Start new. There is supposed to be good land near the Elkhorn."

There probably was. There was good land everywhere out here, if you were willing to fight the weather and the Indians and your own ignorance to claim it. But good land did not help a man with a broken axle and two children and a wife who looked like she had not slept in days.

"Leave the wagon," I said. "Take what you can carry, put the children on the mules, and head back. Find a place to winter. Try again in the spring."

He looked at me as if I had suggested he abandon one of his children.

"The wagon—"

"Is wood and iron. It will still be here when the snow melts, or something like it will be. Your wife and children won't be."

I did not wait for him to answer. I touched my hat to the woman, nodded to the children, and rode on. I did not look back to see what he decided. It was not my business what he decided. I had said what I had to say.

Fort Kearny appeared on the twelfth day, rising out of the flat land like a collection of boxes dropped by a careless god. It was not much to look at—a cluster of wood and sod buildings arranged around a parade ground, with a stockade that would not have stopped a determined child—but it was civilization, of a sort. It was a place where a man could buy supplies and hear news and drink whiskey that had not been carried a thousand miles on muleback.

I stabled my horse and found the sutler's store and bought what I needed. Coffee, flour, bacon, ammunition. And whiskey, three bottles, at a price that would have bought a case in Cleveland. The sutler was a thin man with sharp eyes and a sharper sense of profit, and he watched me count out the money with an expression of professional satisfaction.

"Heading north?" he asked.

"Maybe."

"Heard there's trouble up that way. Sioux been restless since Blue Water."

"When are they not restless?"

He shrugged. "Fair point. You look like a man who can handle himself. Just saying, if you're heading into that country, keep your eyes open."

I thanked him for the advice and carried my supplies out into the cold.

The fort was busy for the season. Soldiers moved between the buildings, their breath steaming in the air. A handful of civilians—traders, trappers, men whose business I did not ask about—sat on benches outside the barracks, smoking and talking. I found a spot near the stove in the trading post and listened.

Most of the talk was what you would expect. The weather, the Indians, the price of goods. A complaint about an officer who had been too free with the lash. A rumor about a gold strike somewhere in the mountains that no one quite believed but everyone half-wanted to check on.

And then, in a lull in the conversation, I heard it again.

"—follows the white buffalo. Swear to God, I saw him myself."

The speaker was a trapper, an old man with a face like worn leather and hands that shook slightly as he held his cup. He was talking to a younger man, a soldier by his coat, who was listening with the skeptical expression of someone who has heard too many tall tales.

"Where?" the soldier asked.

"Up on the Niobrara, maybe three weeks back. I was running my lines, checking for beaver sign—not that there's much beaver left, but a man's got to try—and I saw them. The buffalo first, white as milk, moving along the river bottom. And then, maybe a hundred yards back, a man. Walking. Just walking along behind it, like he didn't have anywhere else to be."

"Could have been any man. Could have been a hunter."

"No hunter walks behind his prey. And this man—" The trapper shook his head. "There was something wrong with him. The way he moved. The way he looked. Like he wasn't all there, if you know what I mean. Like part of him had gone somewhere else and left the rest behind."

The soldier shrugged. "The territory's full of strange ones. Doesn't mean anything."

"Maybe not." The trapper took a drink from his cup. "But I've been out here thirty years, and I never saw anything like that. Never want to again, if I'm honest."

I finished my drink and stood up. The trapper glanced at me as I passed, but said nothing. I went out into the cold and stood for a moment, looking north, toward the country I would be entering.

A man who followed a white buffalo. A man with something wrong with him, something missing.

I had heard the stories in Council Bluffs, and now I was hearing them here. The stories were moving south with the season, spreading along the trails and through the forts, growing with each telling. Soon everyone would have a cousin who had seen the man, a friend who had spoken to someone who knew someone who had watched him pass.

Most of the stories would be lies, or exaggerations, or simple mistakes. A white buffalo was rare but not impossible, and a man alone on the plains was common enough. Put them together and you had a story, but stories were not evidence.

Still. The Niobrara. That was where the Hardins had gone. That was where I was heading.

Perhaps the man who followed the white buffalo had nothing to do with what I was looking for. Perhaps he was just another lost soul, wandering the territory with his own reasons and his own griefs.

Or perhaps not.

I collected my horse and rode out of the fort, heading west along the river, toward the place where the trail turned north.

Three days past Fort Kearny, I met a man named Creighton.

He was camped in a grove of cottonwoods a hundred yards off the main trail, and I smelled his fire before I saw it. I approached carefully—a man alone in this country had reason to be cautious—but he called out before I got close enough to be a threat.

"Come on in if you're friendly. Coffee's hot."

He was a mail carrier, he said, running dispatches between Fort Kearny and Fort Laramie. A small man, wiry, with quick eyes and a way of speaking that suggested he had been alone for too long and was glad of company.

"You're heading the wrong direction for the Laramie road," he said, handing me a tin cup of coffee.

"I'm not going to Laramie."

"Where then?"

"North. The Niobrara country."

He whistled softly. "That's hard territory. Sioux don't like strangers up there. What's your business?"

"Looking for someone."

He did not ask who. Men in this country learned not to ask questions that might have uncomfortable answers.

"Well," he said, "I hope you find them. And I hope they want to be found. Some folks come out here to get lost, you know. They don't take kindly to being tracked down."

I thought about George Hardin, somewhere in that country with his wife, or without her. I thought about what I would do when I found him.

"I'll keep that in mind."

We talked for a while longer, trading news and rumors. He told me about the state of the trails, the disposition of the various Indian bands, the weather he had seen coming down from the north. I told him nothing of consequence. When the coffee was gone, I thanked him and mounted up.

"One more thing," he said, as I was turning to go. "If you're heading up that way, you might hear talk about a man and a white buffalo. People have been seeing them, or saying they have."

"I've heard."

"Well, I've seen them too. About two weeks ago, crossing the Loup Fork. The buffalo was real enough—white as snow, biggest damn cow I ever saw. And the man was real too. Thin as a rail, beard down past his chest, walking along like he had all the time in the world."

"You talk to him?"

Creighton shook his head. "No sir. And I'll tell you why. Because when he looked at me—and he did look, just for a second, before he turned back to that buffalo—there was nothing in his eyes. Nothing at all. Like looking at a dead man who hadn't had the sense to fall down yet."

He spat into the fire. "You find who you're looking for. But if it's that one, maybe think twice before you say hello."

I thanked him again and rode on.
