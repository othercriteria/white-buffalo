# Journal Entry VII

*June the Fourteenth, Eighteen Fifty-Eight*

The herd has turned south again, following the grass into the valleys where the creeks run full from the mountain snows. She is with them, as always, her white coat bright against the green of the early summer meadows. She is magnificent now—fully grown, or nearly so, a thousand pounds of muscle and bone and sacred purpose.

And she has led me back to the homesteaders.

*June the Twenty-First*

I have been watching them for a week.

They are still here, still working their little patch of land, still living their little lives. The man is out early every morning, tending to the animals, working the fields, repairing the endless small damages that the land inflicts on anything built upon it. The woman is never far from the house, cooking and cleaning and doing whatever it is that women do to keep a home running.

They have survived two winters now. That is more than most.

I do not know why I am watching them so closely. They are not a threat to her—not yet, at least. They are too far away, too occupied with their own concerns, to have even noticed the herd grazing in the valley to the north. But something keeps drawing my attention back to them.

Perhaps it is simply that they are the only other people in this country. Perhaps I have been alone so long that even the sight of strangers at a distance feels significant.

Or perhaps it is something else. Something I do not want to name.

*July the Second*

The herd has moved closer.

She leads them now—I have noticed this over the past months. The older cows still make the decisions about where to graze and when to move, but she is the one who goes first, who tests the ground ahead, who stands watch while the others feed. They follow her, these animals, as I follow her. They recognize what she is, even if they cannot understand it.

And she has led them to within a mile of the homestead.

I do not think she is aware of the significance. She is following the grass, the water, the instincts that have guided her kind for longer than men have walked this land. But I am aware. I see the homesteaders' sod house from the ridge where I sit, see the smoke from their chimney, see the man working in his field.

They will notice the herd soon, if they have not already. A hundred buffalo grazing in the next valley is not something that can be overlooked.

And when they notice the herd, they may notice her.

*July the Ninth*

I have been thinking about what to do.

The homesteaders are not a threat. I must be clear about this in my own mind, must not deceive myself into believing something that is not true. They are two people—a man and a woman—living alone on the edge of the wilderness. They have no weapons that I have seen beyond what any homesteader would keep for protection. They have no interest in buffalo, sacred or otherwise. They are simply here, living their lives, posing no danger to anyone.

But they are in the way.

I do not mean this the way a man might mean it when he speaks of obstacles or inconveniences. I mean something more fundamental. They are in the path that she has chosen. They are occupying ground that she may need to cross. They are a presence in this country that could, under certain circumstances, become a problem.

If they see her—if they notice her white coat among the brown—what will they do? They might do nothing. They might simply observe her and wonder at her strangeness and go about their business. That is what most people would do.

But they might not. They might see value in her—in her hide, in her meat, in the story they could tell about killing something so rare. They might try to hunt her, or trap her, or drive the herd away from their land. They might do any number of things that would put her in danger.

I cannot allow that.

*July the Seventeenth*

I have made my decision.

I have wrestled with it for weeks, turning it over in my mind, examining it from every angle. I have tried to find another way, a solution that does not require what I am about to do. I have failed.

The homesteaders must be removed.

I do not write this with pleasure. I do not write it with anger or malice or any of the feelings that might make such a decision comprehensible. I write it as a simple statement of fact, a conclusion that follows inevitably from the premises I have accepted.

She is sacred. She is more important than I am, more important than the homesteaders, more important than anything else in this world. She is the vessel through which my death will have meaning, the only chance I will ever have to make something clean and right out of the wreckage of my life.

I will not let anyone take that from me.

---

*July the Twenty-Fifth*

I have been watching them more closely these past days. Learning their routines, their habits, the patterns of their lives.

The man wakes before dawn and goes to the barn to tend the animals. He stays there for perhaps an hour, sometimes longer. Then he returns to the house and eats whatever the woman has prepared for him. Then he goes to the fields.

The woman wakes later, after the man has left for the barn. She builds up the fire, prepares food, cleans. She spends most of her day in or near the house. She is carrying a child, I think—her belly has the roundness of early pregnancy, though it is hard to be certain at this distance.

A child.

I have thought about this. I have tried to make it matter, to feel something about the fact that I am planning to kill a woman who carries a life inside her. But I cannot. The child is not real to me. It is a possibility, a potential, something that may or may not exist. She is real. The white buffalo is real. What I must do is real.

The rest is abstraction.

*August the Third*

The herd is still nearby. She grazes in the valley every day, visible from the homestead if anyone cared to look. The man has noticed the buffalo—I saw him standing at the edge of his field yesterday, watching them move across the grass. But he did not seem to notice her. Perhaps his eyes are not trained to see what does not belong. Perhaps he simply did not look closely enough.

But he might look more closely tomorrow. He might notice. He might do something.

I cannot wait any longer.

---

*August the Ninth*

It is done.

I do not want to write about it. I have put off writing this entry for days, hoping that the need to record it would fade, that I could simply move forward without looking back. But that is not how this works. I have committed myself to honesty in these pages, and honesty requires that I set down what I have done.

I came to the homestead at dawn, when the man was in the barn. I waited until he came out, waited until he saw me standing in his yard with my knife in my hand. He did not understand at first—I could see the confusion in his face, the struggle to make sense of what he was seeing.

Then he understood, and he tried to fight.

He was not a weak man. He had the strength of someone who has worked the land with his hands, the reflexes of someone who has survived two winters in hard country. He fought well. He almost won.

But I have been fighting longer than he has. I have been fighting since Mexico, since Buena Vista, since I learned what I was and what I could do. He had no chance against me, really. I knew that before I started.

The woman heard the noise and came to the door. I wish she had not. I wish she had stayed inside, had hidden, had given me a reason to spare her. But she came to the door and she saw her husband dying in the yard and she screamed, and then there was no choice left.

There was a hired hand, too. A young man, barely more than a boy, who was sleeping in the barn when I arrived. He woke to the sounds of fighting and tried to run. I caught him in the open, a hundred yards from the house.

Three of them. Three people who had done me no harm, who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, who died because a white buffalo happened to graze in their valley.

I buried them behind the barn. It took me two days, digging in the hard ground, piling rocks over the graves to keep the wolves away. I cleaned what I could of the blood—not for their sake, but because I did not want to leave a mess. And then I left, following the herd, following her, as I have always done.

I thought I would feel more.

I thought the killing would change something in me, would break whatever was left of the man I used to be. But it did not. I feel nothing. The emptiness that has been inside me since Mexico is still there, unchanged, untroubled by what I have done.

Perhaps that is the worst part. Not the killing itself, but the ease of it. The way it cost me nothing that I was not already willing to pay.

I am almost done now. She is fully grown. She is ready.

Soon, very soon, this will be over.
