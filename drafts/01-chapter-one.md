# Chapter One

Ephraim Aldridge had not been inside a tavern in thirty years. He stood now in the doorway of this one, a low-ceilinged room thick with pipe smoke and the smell of men who worked outdoors, and he understood that he had been wrong to think thirty years sufficient preparation.

The place was called The Broken Oar, though they were fifty miles from any water that would require one. It sat at the edge of the town, where the last of the frame houses gave way to forest. November had stripped the trees, and through the tavern's single window Aldridge could see the gray lattice of branches against a grayer sky.

He removed his hat. Several men looked up from their drinks, evaluated him, looked away. He was not what they expected to see, and they had already determined he was not their concern.

The barman was a heavy-set man with a beard that had not been trimmed in some time. He watched Aldridge approach without expression.

"I am looking for a man," Aldridge said.

"We have several."

"His name is Farrell. Henry Farrell."

The barman's expression did not change, but something behind it did. "And who's looking?"

Aldridge had prepared for this. In his business—shipping, dry goods, the movement of capital across the Great Lakes—preparation was everything. He had prepared for this journey as he prepared for all ventures: methodically, thoroughly, with attention to contingency. He had worn his second-best coat, the one that suggested prosperity without ostentation. He had left his pocket watch in his room at the boarding house. He had rehearsed what he would say.

None of it seemed adequate now.

"My name is Ephraim Aldridge. I have come from Oswego. I have a matter that requires a man of particular capabilities, and I have been told that Farrell possesses them."

"Told by who?"

"A man named Garrett, at the lumber office."

The barman considered this. Then he turned and spoke to someone Aldridge could not see, in a back room. There was a murmured exchange. The barman turned back.

"He's not here."

"I was told he would be."

"He was. He left an hour ago."

Aldridge felt something tighten in his chest. He had been traveling for four days. The first day by coach to Syracuse, then the railroad to Rochester, then another coach north into country that grew steadily wilder and less familiar. He had not expected the search itself to be easy, but he had expected that when he found the man, the man would be there to be found.

"Where did he go?"

The barman shrugged. "Didn't say."

"When will he return?"

"Didn't say that either."

Aldridge stood in the smoke and the noise and felt the accumulated exhaustion of the journey settle into him. He was fifty-eight years old. His daughter was dead or in danger, and he was standing in a tavern in a town he had never heard of six months ago, asking after a man who had already left.

"I'll wait," he said.

The barman's expression flickered—something like amusement, or perhaps respect. "As you like. Drink?"

"No. Thank you."

The barman shrugged and turned away.

Aldridge found a table near the window. He sat with his back to the wall, his hat on the table in front of him. The hat was beaver felt, well-made, incongruous. He left it there anyway.

The afternoon passed. Men came and went. Some of them glanced at Aldridge; most did not. He watched the gray light fade toward evening, watched the barman light candles and then lamps. His thoughts moved in circles that had become familiar over the past months: Catherine's last letter, dated March. The silence since. The things a man might do to a woman, alone on the frontier, far from anyone who might help her.

He had not approved of the marriage. George Hardin was a farmer's son from Ohio, a man with more ambition than sense, who had filled Catherine's head with talk of land and opportunity and the future that awaited them in the West. Aldridge had argued against it. He had threatened to cut her off. In the end, he had done neither, because she was his only child and her mother was dead and he could not bear to lose her entirely.

So he had let her go. Nearly three years now, and no grandchildren. He had expected—hoped, at least—that a child might bring her back East, or bring him West to meet it. Her letters had said nothing on the subject, which he took as its own kind of answer. Another sign that the marriage was not what it should be. Another reason to worry.

And now she was gone.

The door opened, letting in a gust of cold air. A man entered, and Aldridge knew at once that this was Farrell.

He was not what Aldridge had expected. The men at the lumber office had spoken of him in terms that suggested something dangerous, something barely contained. But the man who stood in the doorway, stamping snow from his boots, looked merely tired. He was of medium height, lean, with a face that had been weathered past his years. His coat was worn but adequate. He carried no visible weapon, though Aldridge supposed a man like this would not need to make such things visible.

Farrell's eyes moved across the room, taking inventory. They stopped on Aldridge for a moment—the only man sitting alone, the only man who did not belong—and then moved on. He walked to the bar.

The barman spoke to him, low. Farrell listened without expression. Then he turned and looked at Aldridge again, this time with something more than casual interest.

He crossed the room and stood at Aldridge's table. Up close, his eyes were pale, the color difficult to determine in the lamplight. He did not sit.

"You've been waiting," he said. It was not a question.

"Yes."

"Garrett sent you."

"He directed me. He did not send me. I came of my own accord."

Farrell considered this distinction. "Why?"

"I have a proposition. May I buy you a drink?"

"No." But he pulled out a chair and sat, folding his hands on the table. His hands were calloused, the knuckles scarred. "Say what you came to say, Mr. Aldridge."

Aldridge had rehearsed this too. He had written it out, back in Oswego, before he left. He had refined it during the journey, honing each phrase until it conveyed precisely what he needed to convey and nothing more. Now the words seemed foolish, inadequate.

"My daughter," he said. "Her name is Catherine. She married a man named George Hardin nearly three years ago, against my wishes. They went west. Nebraska Territory, or thereabouts. She wrote to me regularly—every month, sometimes more often. Her letters stopped in March."

Farrell's expression did not change. He was listening, but not reacting. Aldridge found this more unnerving than hostility would have been.

"I have made inquiries," Aldridge continued. "I have written to every authority I could identify—federal, territorial, military. The responses have been unhelpful. The territory is vast, and there are many homesteads, and records are not kept as they would be in the East. No one knows anything about the Hardins. No one has seen them. No one can tell me if my daughter is alive or dead."

"And you want me to find out."

"Yes."

"Why me?"

Aldridge had expected this question. "Because the men at the lumber office, and the men I spoke to before them, say that you have done this kind of work before. Finding people. Learning things. And because—" He hesitated.

"And because they say I'm not particular about what happens when I find them."

Aldridge said nothing.

Farrell leaned back in his chair. "What do you think happened to your daughter, Mr. Aldridge?"

"I think her husband killed her."

The words hung in the air between them. Aldridge had not said them aloud before. He had thought them, in the small hours of the night when sleep would not come. He had written them in a letter he did not send. But he had not spoken them until now.

"Why?"

"Because the letters stopped. Because she would have written to me, if she could. Because I know—" He stopped, collected himself. "Because I know that she was unhappy. Her last letters were not like the others. She did not say so directly, but I could tell. A father knows."

Farrell watched him for a long moment. Then he said: "You want me to find your daughter. And if she's dead, you want me to deal with her husband."

"Yes."

"Deal with him how?"

"As you judge necessary."

The silence stretched. Someone laughed at the bar, the sound jarringly normal. Aldridge waited.

"The territory is large," Farrell said. "Winter is coming. Travel will be difficult."

"I understand."

"I may not find her. I may not find anything."

"I understand that too."

"And if I do find her—if she's alive, and simply stopped writing—what then?"

Aldridge had not prepared for this question. He found he did not have an answer.

"Then you tell me," he said finally. "And I will decide what to do."

Farrell nodded slowly. He seemed to be calculating something—distances, perhaps, or odds, or the measure of the man across from him. "It will cost you."

"I expected as much."

"Two hundred dollars. Half now, half when I return with an answer. Expenses on top of that."

It was a large sum. Not ruinous, for a man of Aldridge's means, but large. He did not hesitate.

"Agreed."

He reached into his coat and withdrew an envelope. He had prepared this too, back in Oswego. The bills were crisp, counted three times. He slid the envelope across the table.

Farrell took it, glanced inside, did not count. He folded the envelope and put it in his own coat.

"I'll need to know everything you know. Her letters, if you have them. The location of the homestead, as best you can determine. The husband's name and history, anything that might be useful."

"I have prepared a packet. It is at my room, at the boarding house."

"I'll come by in the morning."

Farrell stood. He looked down at Aldridge, and his expression shifted—something flickered across it that might have been pity, or might have been recognition.

"You should prepare yourself, Mr. Aldridge. For what I might find."

"I have prepared myself."

"No," Farrell said. "You haven't."

He turned and walked to the bar, spoke briefly with the barman, and then was gone, out into the night. The door closed behind him, and the cold air that had followed him in dissipated, absorbed into the warmth of the room.

Aldridge sat at his table for a long time. The beaver-felt hat sat before him, as incongruous as ever. He did not touch his pocket, did not check that the packet of letters was still there, though he wanted to. He had read them so many times that he knew them by heart. The early ones, full of hope and descriptions of the land. The middle ones, more measured, the hope beginning to curdle. And the last one, dated March the fourteenth, in which Catherine had written that the winter was finally breaking and that the snow was melting and that she hoped the worst was behind them.

He had not known, when he read it, that it would be the last.

The barman came by, asked again if he wanted a drink. This time Aldridge said yes. He drank it without tasting it, paid, and left. The night was cold, colder than it had been when he arrived, and the walk back to the boarding house was long. But he walked it, because there was nothing else to do.

In the morning, Farrell came for the packet. They spoke briefly, exchanged what information there was to exchange. Aldridge gave him the letters, and a map he had drawn from memory and hope, and a description of George Hardin that relied too much on his own animosity to be trusted. Farrell took it all without comment.

"How long?" Aldridge asked.

"Months. Maybe longer. Depends on what I find, and where."

"And you'll send word?"

"If I can."

They shook hands. Farrell's grip was firm, businesslike. Then he was gone, walking west along the main street, and Aldridge stood in the doorway of the boarding house and watched him until he disappeared around a corner.

He had done what he could. He had sent a man to find his daughter, to learn the truth, to deliver justice if justice was warranted. It was out of his hands now.

He went back inside, packed his bag, and began the long journey home. The country outside the coach window was bleak and cold, the fields fallow, the trees bare. He watched it pass and thought of Catherine, and of the man he had hired to find her, and of what that man might do when he did.

He found that he did not want to think about that last part too closely. He found that this was why he had hired Farrell in the first place—so that he would not have to.

The coach rattled on, east toward Oswego, toward the lake, toward home.
