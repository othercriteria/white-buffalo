# Journal Entry III

*September the Twelfth, Eighteen Fifty-Six*

The leaves are turning on the cottonwoods along the river. Yellow and gold against the brown of the grass, the blue of the sky. I had forgotten that the world could be beautiful. I had forgotten that I was capable of noticing.

She is growing well. Her shoulders have thickened, and the hump of muscle behind her neck has begun to rise. She stands taller than the other calves now, though whether this is because of her nature or simply because she has had good grazing, I cannot say. Her coat remains white. I had wondered if it might darken as she aged, as the coats of some animals do, but it has not. If anything, it has grown brighter, more luminous, as if lit from within.

I watch her every day. I know her movements now as well as I know my own. The way she wakes before the others and stands apart, testing the air. The way she grazes in long, slow sweeps, her head down, her white form moving through the brown grass like a ship through water. The way she lies down in the afternoon heat, always a little apart from the herd, her legs folded beneath her, her eyes half-closed.

She knows I am here. She must. The other buffalo have accepted my presence—they no longer startle when I approach, no longer shift away when I pass—and she has done the same. But there is something different in the way she watches me. A wariness, perhaps, or a curiosity. I cannot tell which.

I do not try to approach her. I keep my distance, as I have since the beginning. It would not do to make her fear me. When the time comes, I need her to stand her ground.

*September the Twenty-Eighth*

The herd has been moving south, following the river toward the lower country. The nights are growing cold, and the buffalo know what is coming. They have been making this journey for longer than men have been here to see it.

I move with them. I have no gear to speak of—a blanket, a knife, this journal—and so I can travel as fast as they do. Sometimes I walk beside them, a hundred yards off, keeping pace with the slow roll of their movement. Sometimes I sit on a rise and watch them pass, counting the animals as they go, looking for her white form among the brown.

She is always there. Always visible, even at a distance. A bright spot moving through the herd, like a star fallen to earth and walking among cattle.

I have been thinking about what I did in Mexico.

I do not like to think about it. I have spent years not thinking about it, filling my mind with work and whiskey and the small distractions that make up a life. But out here there is nothing to distract me. There is only the grass and the sky and the buffalo and the long hours of walking, and in those hours the memories come whether I want them or not.

I was a good soldier. That is the first thing to understand. I did what I was told, and I did it well. When they said advance, I advanced. When they said fire, I fired. When they said hold this position until relieved, I held it, though the relief came late and the position was costly to hold.

I was promoted twice. Once after Monterrey, once after Buena Vista. They made me a corporal, and then they made me a sergeant, and both times they told me it was because I had shown courage under fire. But it was not courage. It was something else, something I did not have a name for then and do not have a name for now.

It was a kind of emptiness. A place inside me where the fear should have been, where the hesitation should have been, that was simply not there. When other men froze, I moved. When other men ran, I stood. Not because I was brave, but because I could not feel the things that made them freeze and run.

I do not know when this emptiness came to me. Perhaps I was born with it. Perhaps it was made in me by the things I saw as a boy—my father's rages, my mother's silences, the poverty and violence that were the only constants of my childhood. Perhaps it does not matter where it came from. What matters is that it was there, and that the army found a use for it.

At Buena Vista, I killed a man with my hands. He was a Mexican lancer, separated from his unit, and he came at me with his sword and I caught his arm and I broke it and then I put my hands around his throat and I squeezed until he stopped moving. It took a long time. He was strong, and he fought, and I watched his face as he died and I felt nothing.

That is the thing I have been carrying. That is the thing I came out here to answer for.

The white buffalo cannot absolve me. I know that. There is no absolution for what I am. But she can end me, and that is close enough.

*October the Ninth*

Cold rain today, the first of the season. I sheltered in a stand of willows and watched the herd endure it, their great heads bowed against the weather, their breath steaming in the chill air. She stood among them, her white coat darkened by the wet, her eyes half-closed against the wind.

I thought about going to her. The rain was cold, and I was tired, and it would have been easy to walk out into the herd and lie down beside her and let the cold take me. But that is not the death I am waiting for. That would be too easy, too ordinary. I need something more.

I need her to kill me. I need to die by something sacred, something that should not exist, something that carries meaning in its blood and bones. I need my death to mean something, even if my life did not.

This is vanity, I know. Pride dressed up as penance. But it is all I have.

*October the Twenty-Third*

She is beautiful.

I did not want to write that. It seems foolish, sentimental, the kind of thing a man writes when he has been alone too long. But it is true, and I have promised myself to write only true things in this journal.

She is beautiful in the way that dangerous things are beautiful. In the way that a storm is beautiful, or a fire, or the edge of a knife. There is power in her, coiled and waiting, and when she moves you can see it in the way her muscles shift beneath her skin, in the way her hooves strike the ground. She is not yet full-grown, but she is no longer a calf. She is becoming what she was meant to be.

I watched her today as she grazed alone at the edge of the herd. The sun was setting, and the light was the color of copper, and she stood against it like something out of a dream. Her coat caught the light and held it, glowing, and for a moment I could believe what the Indians believe—that she is sacred, that she was sent by something greater than herself, that she carries a message for those who have eyes to see.

I do not know what the message is. Perhaps it is different for everyone who sees her.

For me, I think, the message is simple: wait. Be patient. Your time will come.

I can wait. I have learned how.
