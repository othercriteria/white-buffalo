# Chapter Five

The main trail continued west along the Platte, toward Fort Laramie and the mountains beyond. I turned north.

The country changed as soon as I left the river. The flat bottomland gave way to rolling hills, then to a landscape of broken ridges and deep draws that seemed to have been made by a god who could not decide what he wanted. The trail—if you could call it a trail—was little more than a track worn by animals and the occasional traveler, winding through the hills in a way that suggested it was following the path of least resistance rather than any particular destination.

The snow was deeper here, where the wind had less chance to scour it away. Some mornings I woke to find drifts piled against the side of my shelter that reached higher than my horse's head. Some days the going was so slow that I made less than five miles between dawn and dark.

I rationed my whiskey carefully. Two drinks at night, no more, regardless of how much I wanted. The bottles were half-empty now, and I did not know when I would find more. The want was a constant presence, a pressure behind my eyes, a tremor in my hands that I had learned to ignore. I had been through worse, years ago, when I had run out entirely and had to wait three days for a supply train that never came. I could manage this.

The cold was another kind of want. It wanted inside me, wanted to curl up in my bones and sleep there until spring. I fought it with fire and with movement and with the stubborn conviction that I would not die in a place this empty, for a reason this trivial. I had survived Mexico. I had survived ten years of slow drowning in whiskey and regret. I would survive this.

On the fourth day north, I came across a dead man.

He was frozen solid, lying in a draw where the snow had drifted over him almost to the top of his head. I might have passed him by if I hadn't noticed the hand—pale and stiff, reaching up out of the white as if grasping for something he could not quite reach.

I dismounted and dug him out. It took the better part of an hour, working with my knife and my hands, the frozen snow crumbling away in chunks. He was a young man, perhaps twenty-five, dressed in the clothes of a settler or a small trader. No coat—he had either lost it or never had one. No supplies, no weapon, no horse.

His face was peaceful. Whatever had killed him, he had not fought it at the end.

I searched his pockets and found a handful of coins, a folding knife, and a letter that had been ruined by the wet and the cold. I could make out a few words—*dearest* and *hope* and *soon*—but nothing that told me who he was or where he had been going.

I thought about burying him, but the ground was frozen too hard, and I had no shovel. I thought about marking the spot, but there was nothing to mark it with that would last until spring. In the end, I covered him back up with the snow I had dug away and rode on.

There was nothing else to do.

The trading post appeared on the sixth day, squatting at the junction of two frozen creeks like something that had grown there rather than been built. It was a sod house, low and rough, with a roof of logs and turf that sagged in the middle under the weight of snow. Smoke rose from a chimney pipe, and a horse stood in a lean-to stable against the south wall, its breath steaming in the cold air.

I dismounted and tied my horse beside the other and went inside.

The interior was a single room, perhaps twenty feet by fifteen, lit by a pair of candles and the glow of a cast-iron stove in the corner. The walls were lined with shelves holding the kind of goods a man might need in this country: traps and ammunition, blankets and flour, tobacco and salt. A counter made of rough-hewn planks divided the space in two, and behind it sat a man who looked like he had been waiting there since the ice age.

"Close the door," he said. "You're letting in the cold."

I closed the door. The warmth of the stove wrapped around me like a hand, and I felt the tension in my shoulders begin to ease.

"You have whiskey?"

"Some. It's dear."

"How dear?"

He named a price that would have made the sutler at Fort Kearny weep with envy. I paid it anyway, and he produced a bottle from beneath the counter—unlabeled, the glass cloudy with age or manufacture.

"Anything else?"

"Information. I'm looking for a homestead. Family named Hardin. Man and wife, settled somewhere up the Niobrara."

The trader's eyes narrowed slightly. "You law?"

"No."

"Bounty hunter?"

"No. I've been hired by the woman's father. He hasn't heard from her in months."

The trader considered this. His face was weathered past any particular age, the skin tight over bones that suggested he had been thin for a very long time.

"The Hardins," he said. "Yeah, I know them. Knew them. Haven't seen either one since last summer."

"Where's their place?"

"Up the river, maybe two days' ride if the snow holds. There's a creek comes in from the north—can't miss it, it's the only one for ten miles. Their place is a mile or so up that creek. Sod house, like this one, only smaller."

"You said you haven't seen them since summer."

"That's right. They came through a few times, when they first settled. Seemed like decent people. The woman was Eastern, you could tell—didn't know what she was getting into. The man knew, but he was the kind who thought he could handle anything." The trader shook his head. "Most of them are, when they start. Most of them learn different."

"You think something happened to them?"

"I think a lot of things happen to a lot of people out here. I don't go looking for trouble, and trouble doesn't come looking for me. They stopped coming in, I figured they either got smart and left, or got unlucky and didn't."

I took a drink from the bottle. The whiskey was rough, with an aftertaste that suggested it had been made in a place that did not concern itself overly with quality. But it was whiskey, and it did what whiskey was supposed to do.

"You hear about a man who follows a white buffalo?" I asked.

The trader's expression changed—not much, but enough that I noticed.

"Where'd you hear about that?"

"Fort Kearny. And a mail rider on the trail."

"Huh." He was quiet for a moment, looking at the stove as if the answer might be written in the glow of the coals. "Yeah, I heard about him. More than heard. I saw him once, maybe four months back. Came through here on his way north, the buffalo out ahead of him and him trailing behind like a dog that's lost its master."

"You talk to him?"

"Tried to. Called out to him as he passed. He looked at me—" The trader stopped, shook his head. "He looked at me like I wasn't there. Like I was a tree or a rock, something to walk around, not something to talk to. Then he just kept walking."

"What did he look like?"

"Tall. Thin. Beard like a bird's nest. Clothes that looked like they'd been through a war and lost. And his eyes—" Another pause. "You ever see a man who's given up? Not on a particular thing, but on everything? On being a man, on being alive, on giving a damn about anything this side of the grave?"

"I've seen men like that."

"Then you know what I'm talking about. That's what he looked like. Like he was already dead and just hadn't stopped moving yet."

I finished the whiskey in my cup and poured another. The trader watched me but did not comment.

"The Hardins' place," I said. "Two days up the river, creek from the north."

"That's right. You going out there?"

"That's what I'm being paid for."

He shrugged. "Your business. But if I were you, I'd keep my eyes open. That country up there—it's not friendly. The Indians don't like strangers, and the land doesn't like anyone."

"I'll manage."

"Maybe you will." He did not sound convinced. "You need supplies? I've got flour, bacon, coffee. The prices are fair, considering what it costs to get anything out here."

I bought what I needed, paid what he asked, and asked if I could sleep in the stable with my horse. He said I could, for a price. I paid that too.

That night I lay in the straw, wrapped in my blankets, listening to the wind howl outside and thinking about the man who followed the white buffalo. Four months ago, the trader had said. That put him in this area around August, September. Around the time Catherine Hardin's letters had stopped.

Maybe it meant nothing. The territory was large, and coincidences were common, and a man who followed a buffalo had no obvious reason to harm a settler family who happened to live nearby.

But I had learned, over the years, to pay attention to coincidences. They were not always what they seemed.

I left the trading post at dawn, riding north along the frozen river. The first day I made good time. The sky was clear, the wind light, and the river showed me the way north as clearly as any road. I counted the creeks as I passed them, as the trader had instructed, and I camped that night in a stand of pines on a south-facing slope where the snow was thin and the deadfall plentiful.

The second day, the country began to look the same.

The hills rolled on in every direction, white and gray and featureless, each one identical to the last. The creeks that fed the river came down from the north at irregular intervals, some wide and obvious, others little more than frozen trickles that might have been creeks or might have been nothing at all. I counted them as I had been counting, but I began to lose confidence in my count.

Had that been a creek, or just a fold in the land? Had I missed one earlier, passed it without noticing? The trader had said the Hardins' creek was the only one for ten miles, but how would I know? The country kept its secrets.

I saw antelope that day, a small herd moving across a distant ridge, their tan coats stark against the white. I thought about hunting them—my supplies were adequate but not generous—but they were too far, and I had neither the time nor the ammunition to waste on a chase that might lead nowhere.

That night I heard coyotes for the first time. They started after dark, a single voice rising from somewhere to the west, and then others answering—a chorus of yips and howls that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. The sound raised the hair on my neck. It was not threatening, exactly, but it was wild in a way that reminded me how far I was from anything I knew.

The horse did not like it either. He stamped and snorted, pulling at his tether, and I had to speak to him softly for a long time before he settled.

On the third day, I crossed a creek I thought was the one I was looking for, and followed it north for three hours before I realized my mistake. The valley narrowed to a dead end, the hills closing in on either side, and there was no homestead here, no sign that anyone had ever lived in this place.

I turned back. Three hours wasted, and the short winter day already half-gone. I made camp early that night, in a hollow that offered little shelter, and I lay awake listening to the wind and thinking about how easy it would be to die out here. Not dramatically, not heroically, but simply—a wrong turn, a missed landmark, a night without fire, and in the morning nothing but a shape under the snow that no one would find until spring.

The fourth day I found the right creek.

I knew it as soon as I saw it—wider than the others, the valley opening out to the north, the willows along its banks brown and thick. I turned up it and felt something ease in my chest, some tension I had not known I was carrying.

But the country was not done with me yet.

The crossing looked easy enough—the ice was thick, the surface smooth, the far bank no more than twenty feet away. I started across without dismounting, the horse picking his way carefully, testing each step before committing his weight.

We were halfway across when the ice cracked.

It did not break—not entirely—but I heard it, a sound like a gunshot, and felt the surface shift beneath us. The horse lurched forward, panicking, his hooves scrabbling for purchase, and I threw myself from the saddle as the ice tilted and groaned.

I hit the far bank on my hands and knees, scrambling up the frozen mud, and turned to see the horse still on the ice, frozen with fear, his legs splayed wide. The surface was buckled now, water seeping up through the cracks, and I could see the dark of the creek beneath.

"Come on," I said. My voice was steadier than I felt. "Come on, boy. Easy now."

He would not move. His eyes were wide and white, his whole body trembling, and I knew that if he panicked again—if he tried to run—the ice would give way beneath him and he would go through.

I talked to him. I do not remember what I said, but I talked, keeping my voice low and steady, the way you talk to something that does not understand words but understands tone. Slowly, slowly, I moved back onto the ice, testing each step, feeling it flex beneath my weight.

I reached him and took the reins. I could feel his fear through the leather, the way his whole body was strung tight, ready to bolt. I stroked his neck and talked to him and began to lead him forward, one step at a time, toward the bank.

We made it. The ice held. But when we reached solid ground, my legs gave out beneath me and I sat in the snow for a long time, shaking, while the horse stood beside me and steamed in the cold air.

That night I built a fire larger than I needed and sat close to it, feeling the warmth on my face, listening to the ice on the creek settle and crack in the darkness. I was close now. The homestead was perhaps a day's ride, maybe less.

But the country had reminded me what it could do. The country did not care whether I found what I was looking for or not.

On the sixth day, I found the homestead.
