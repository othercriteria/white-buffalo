# Chapter Five

The main trail continued west along the Platte, toward Fort Laramie and the mountains beyond. I turned north.

The country changed as soon as I left the river. The flat bottomland gave way to rolling hills, then to a landscape of broken ridges and deep draws that seemed to have been made by a god who could not decide what he wanted. The trail—if you could call it a trail—was little more than a track worn by animals and the occasional traveler, winding through the hills in a way that suggested it was following the path of least resistance rather than any particular destination.

The snow was deeper here, where the wind had less chance to scour it away. Some mornings I woke to find drifts piled against the side of my shelter that reached higher than my horse's head. Some days the going was so slow that I made less than five miles between dawn and dark.

I rationed my whiskey carefully. Two drinks at night, no more, regardless of how much I wanted. The bottles were half-empty now, and I did not know when I would find more. The want was a constant presence, a pressure behind my eyes, a tremor in my hands that I had learned to ignore. I had been through worse, years ago, when I had run out entirely and had to wait three days for a supply train that never came. I could manage this.

The cold was another kind of want. It wanted inside me, wanted to curl up in my bones and sleep there until spring. I fought it with fire and with movement and with the stubborn conviction that I would not die in a place this empty, for a reason this trivial. I had survived Mexico. I had survived ten years of slow drowning in whiskey and regret. I would survive this.

On the fourth day north, I came across a dead man.

He was frozen solid, lying in a draw where the snow had drifted over him almost to the top of his head. I might have passed him by if I hadn't noticed the hand—pale and stiff, reaching up out of the white as if grasping for something he could not quite reach.

I dismounted and dug him out. It took the better part of an hour, working with my knife and my hands, the frozen snow crumbling away in chunks. He was a young man, perhaps twenty-five, dressed in the clothes of a settler or a small trader. No coat—he had either lost it or never had one. No supplies, no weapon, no horse.

His face was peaceful. Whatever had killed him, he had not fought it at the end.

I searched his pockets and found a handful of coins, a folding knife, and a letter that had been ruined by the wet and the cold. I could make out a few words—*dearest* and *hope* and *soon*—but nothing that told me who he was or where he had been going.

I thought about burying him, but the ground was frozen too hard, and I had no shovel. I thought about marking the spot, but there was nothing to mark it with that would last until spring. In the end, I covered him back up with the snow I had dug away and rode on.

There was nothing else to do.

The trading post appeared on the sixth day, squatting at the junction of two frozen creeks like something that had grown there rather than been built. It was a sod house, low and rough, with a roof of logs and turf that sagged in the middle under the weight of snow. Smoke rose from a chimney pipe, and a horse stood in a lean-to stable against the south wall, its breath steaming in the cold air.

I dismounted and tied my horse beside the other and went inside.

The interior was a single room, perhaps twenty feet by fifteen, lit by a pair of candles and the glow of a cast-iron stove in the corner. The walls were lined with shelves holding the kind of goods a man might need in this country: traps and ammunition, blankets and flour, tobacco and salt. A counter made of rough-hewn planks divided the space in two, and behind it sat a man who looked like he had been waiting there since the ice age.

"Close the door," he said. "You're letting in the cold."

I closed the door. The warmth of the stove wrapped around me like a hand, and I felt the tension in my shoulders begin to ease.

"You have whiskey?"

"Some. It's dear."

"How dear?"

He named a price that would have made the sutler at Fort Kearny weep with envy. I paid it anyway, and he produced a bottle from beneath the counter—unlabeled, the glass cloudy with age or manufacture.

"Anything else?"

"Information. I'm looking for a homestead. Family named Hardin. Man and wife, settled somewhere up the Niobrara."

The trader's eyes narrowed slightly. "You law?"

"No."

"Bounty hunter?"

"No. I've been hired by the woman's father. He hasn't heard from her in months."

The trader considered this. His face was weathered past any particular age, the skin tight over bones that suggested he had been thin for a very long time.

"The Hardins," he said. "Yeah, I know them. Knew them. Haven't seen either one since last summer."

"Where's their place?"

"Up the river, maybe two days' ride if the snow holds. There's a creek comes in from the north—can't miss it, it's the only one for ten miles. Their place is a mile or so up that creek. Sod house, like this one, only smaller."

"You said you haven't seen them since summer."

"That's right. They came in once, early on, for supplies. Seemed like decent people. The woman was Eastern, you could tell—didn't know what she was getting into. The man knew, but he was the kind who thought he could handle anything." The trader shook his head. "Most of them are, when they start. Most of them learn different."

"You think something happened to them?"

"I think a lot of things happen to a lot of people out here. I don't go looking for trouble, and trouble doesn't come looking for me. They stopped coming in, I figured they either got smart and left, or got unlucky and didn't."

I took a drink from the bottle. The whiskey was rough, with an aftertaste that suggested it had been made in a place that did not concern itself overly with quality. But it was whiskey, and it did what whiskey was supposed to do.

"You hear about a man who follows a white buffalo?" I asked.

The trader's expression changed—not much, but enough that I noticed.

"Where'd you hear about that?"

"Fort Kearny. And a mail rider on the trail."

"Huh." He was quiet for a moment, looking at the stove as if the answer might be written in the glow of the coals. "Yeah, I heard about him. More than heard. I saw him once, maybe four months back. Came through here on his way north, the buffalo out ahead of him and him trailing behind like a dog that's lost its master."

"You talk to him?"

"Tried to. Called out to him as he passed. He looked at me—" The trader stopped, shook his head. "He looked at me like I wasn't there. Like I was a tree or a rock, something to walk around, not something to talk to. Then he just kept walking."

"What did he look like?"

"Tall. Thin. Beard like a bird's nest. Clothes that looked like they'd been through a war and lost. And his eyes—" Another pause. "You ever see a man who's given up? Not on a particular thing, but on everything? On being a man, on being alive, on giving a damn about anything this side of the grave?"

"I've seen men like that."

"Then you know what I'm talking about. That's what he looked like. Like he was already dead and just hadn't stopped moving yet."

I finished the whiskey in my cup and poured another. The trader watched me but did not comment.

"The Hardins' place," I said. "Two days up the river, creek from the north."

"That's right. You going out there?"

"That's what I'm being paid for."

He shrugged. "Your business. But if I were you, I'd keep my eyes open. That country up there—it's not friendly. The Indians don't like strangers, and the land doesn't like anyone."

"I'll manage."

"Maybe you will." He did not sound convinced. "You need supplies? I've got flour, bacon, coffee. The prices are fair, considering what it costs to get anything out here."

I bought what I needed, paid what he asked, and asked if I could sleep in the stable with my horse. He said I could, for a price. I paid that too.

That night I lay in the straw, wrapped in my blankets, listening to the wind howl outside and thinking about the man who followed the white buffalo. Four months ago, the trader had said. That put him in this area around August, September. Around the time Catherine Hardin's letters had stopped.

Maybe it meant nothing. The territory was large, and coincidences were common, and a man who followed a buffalo had no obvious reason to harm a settler family who happened to live nearby.

But I had learned, over the years, to pay attention to coincidences. They were not always what they seemed.

I left the trading post at dawn, riding north along the frozen river. The country was empty and white and silent, and I did not see another living thing until midday, when a herd of antelope crossed my path a quarter mile ahead, their tan coats stark against the snow.

The river wound through the hills in long, lazy curves, its surface frozen solid, its banks lined with bare willows and cottonwoods. I followed it as the trader had directed, counting the creeks that fed into it from the north, waiting for the one that would lead me to the Hardins' homestead.

On the second day, I found it.
