# Journal Entry IX

*Undated*

The sun will rise soon. I can see the first gray light in the eastern sky, the darkness giving way to something that is not yet day but is no longer night. The cold is severe—I can feel it pressing in from all sides, finding every gap in my blanket—but I do not mind. After today, the cold will not matter.

I have not slept. I tried, but sleep would not come, and eventually I stopped trying. I have been sitting here in the darkness, watching the light grow, writing these last words by the glow of a single candle.

This is the end of my account. Whatever happens in the next few hours, I will not write again.

---

I want to say something true. I want to leave behind, for whoever finds this journal, some record of what I was and what I did and why I did it. But the truth is difficult, and I am not sure I have ever been capable of telling it.

Let me try.

I was born in Virginia in the year eighteen twenty-four. My father was a farmer who drank too much and beat his wife and children when the drink was in him. My mother was a silent woman who endured what she could not change. I was the youngest of four children, and I learned early that the world was a place of pain and that the only way to survive it was to become hard enough that the pain could not reach you.

I enlisted in the army in eighteen forty-five. I do not remember why. Perhaps I thought it would take me somewhere better. Perhaps I simply wanted to leave Virginia. Perhaps I was already looking for something to kill me, though I did not know it then.

They sent us to Mexico. We marched south through country I had never seen, country that was beautiful and terrible and nothing like home. We fought battles whose names I learned only afterward—Palo Alto, Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey. We killed men who were defending their own land, and we told ourselves we were doing it for glory, for our country, for God.

Then came Buena Vista.

---

I have never written about Buena Vista. I have never spoken about it to anyone. The memories have lived inside me for twelve years, growing heavier with each year that passes, and I have carried them alone because there was no one I could share them with.

We were outnumbered. That is the first thing to understand. General Santa Anna had brought twenty thousand men against our four thousand, and we knew that if they broke our lines we would all die. So we did not let them break our lines. We held, and we fought, and we killed, and we held some more.

I was in the center of the line, with the Mississippi Rifles. Colonel Davis—the same man who now speaks in Congress of states' rights and Southern honor—was our commander. He was a brave man. He led from the front, and he expected us to follow, and we did.

The Mexicans came at us in waves. Cavalry first, then infantry, wave after wave of men in blue uniforms with bayonets fixed and flags flying. We shot them down and they kept coming. We shot them down again and they kept coming again. The field in front of us filled with bodies, and still they came, climbing over their own dead to reach us.

I killed that day. I do not know how many. Dozens, certainly. Perhaps more. I loaded and fired and loaded and fired until my rifle was too hot to hold, and then I took another from a dead man and loaded and fired that one too. I did not feel anything. I did not think anything. I was a machine, a mechanism designed for a single purpose, and I fulfilled that purpose with an efficiency that should have horrified me.

It did not horrify me. That is what I could not understand, afterward. It should have horrified me—the blood, the screaming, the way men looked when they died, the sounds they made. But I felt nothing. I was empty inside, hollow, a shell in the shape of a man.

The battle ended. We won, if you can call it winning—if survival against impossible odds can be called victory. General Taylor commended us. Colonel Davis was wounded and carried off the field. And I sat among the dead, surrounded by men I had killed, and I waited to feel something.

I am still waiting.

That is what she means to me. That is why I have followed her across these plains for two years, why I have given up everything I had and everything I might have been for the chance to die by her hooves.

She is sacred. The Indians know this. They have stories about her, legends that say she was sent to bring them closer to whatever power governs this world. When they see her, they see meaning. They see hope. They see something that connects this world to something greater.

I see that too. But I see something else as well.

I see the only thing that can make sense of what I am. The only death that can redeem a life spent in emptiness. The only end that can transform a beginning marked by violence and pain.

I killed men at Buena Vista and felt nothing. I killed the homesteaders and felt nothing. I have moved through the world for thirty-four years feeling nothing, and I am tired. I am so tired.

She can end that. She can take this hollow thing I have become and unmake it. She can give my death a meaning that my life never had.

---

The light is growing stronger now. I can see the valley below, and the herd gathered there, and her white form standing apart from the others. She is facing east, toward the rising sun. She is waiting.

I will go to her now.

I will walk down from this ridge and cross the meadow and approach her as I have approached her a thousand times before. But this time I will not stop. This time I will not keep my distance. This time I will run toward her, and I will force her to see me as a threat, and she will do what her nature demands.

It will hurt. I know that. The horns, the hooves, the weight of her body—it will hurt more than anything I have ever felt. But it will not hurt for long. And when it is over, I will be gone, and she will still be here, sacred and wild and free.

I hope the Indians find her. I hope they take her back to wherever she belongs, to whatever sacred place she came from. I hope they know what she did for me, though they will probably not understand it, though they will probably think I was mad.

Perhaps I was. Perhaps this whole enterprise has been the work of a broken mind, grasping at meaning where there was none. But even if that is true—even if there is no redemption, no transformation, no sacred death—it does not matter. The belief is enough. The hope is enough.

I am going to die today. That is the only certainty I have ever had.

---

To whoever finds this journal: I am sorry for the things I have done. I am sorry for the Hardins, who did me no harm and died because I could not find another way. I am sorry for everyone I killed in Mexico, for their families, for their children. I am sorry for the pain I have caused and the lives I have ended and the emptiness I have spread across this world.

But I am not sorry for this. I am not sorry for following her. I am not sorry for waiting. I am not sorry for the death I am about to seek.

This is the right thing. The only right thing I have ever done.

The sun is rising. She is waiting.

I am going now.
