# Journal Entry II

*June the Seventh, Eighteen Fifty-Six*

Seven weeks I have followed her. Seven weeks since I first saw her white coat moving through the grass, since I understood what I must do and what I must wait for.

She has grown. Not much—calves do not grow quickly in their first months—but enough that I can see it. Her legs are longer, her body fuller. The white of her coat remains pure, unmarked by the dust and the mud that stain the other animals. She is kept clean by something I do not understand.

The herd has accepted my presence, or at least they no longer flee when I approach. I keep my distance—two hundred yards, sometimes more—and I move when they move, rest when they rest. I have become part of the landscape to them, as I was to the other herds before. A strange animal, upright and slow, but not a threat.

The calf is always near the center of the herd, surrounded by cows. I have noticed that the other animals treat her differently than they treat the ordinary calves. They give her more space. They watch her more carefully. Whether this is because of her color or for some other reason I cannot say.

I eat when I can. The wolves are generous in their leavings, and I have found other sources—roots, berries, the eggs of ground-nesting birds. I am growing thinner. My clothes hang loose. But I do not need much to sustain myself. The body is a simple machine when you strip away the appetites.

I sleep poorly. The dreams are bad. I do not write them down. There is no point.

*June the Twentieth*

I have begun to understand her patterns. She wakes before the others, in the gray light before dawn, and she stands apart from the herd for a few minutes, her head raised, her nostrils working. She is testing the air, I think, though for what I cannot say. Then she returns to the group and begins to graze.

She grazes differently than the others. They put their heads down and eat steadily, methodically, working through the grass in long sweeps. She is more selective. She moves from patch to patch, taking a few bites here, a few there, as if looking for something specific. Perhaps she is. I do not know what white buffalo eat. Perhaps they require things that ordinary buffalo do not.

In the heat of the afternoon, when the herd clusters together in the shade of the low hills, she lies apart. Not far—twenty feet, thirty—but apart. The other calves pile together, seeking comfort in closeness. She does not.

I wonder if she is lonely. I wonder if she knows she is different.

*July the Third*

The herd has turned north. I do not know why. Perhaps the grass is better there, or the water. Perhaps something I cannot perceive has driven them. I follow.

The country here is empty in a way I had not imagined. I have been west before, but not this far, not into the true plains. Here there is nothing but grass and sky, the two meeting at a line so distant it seems to belong to another world. A man could walk for days and see nothing but the same endless brown and blue.

I am being refined. I feel it happening. The things I carried with me—memories, desires, the weight of what I was—are falling away like dead skin. I am becoming simpler, purer. I am becoming what I need to be.

In Mexico I was made into a weapon. That is the truth of it, however I might wish to say it differently. They took the boy I was and they filed him down and they put an edge on him and they pointed him at other men. I was good at it. That is the other truth, the one I wish I could deny.

I killed seventeen men with certainty and perhaps more. Some of them I saw clearly, their faces visible in the instant before I fired. Some of them I did not see at all—just shapes in the smoke, falling when I pulled the trigger. After a time I stopped counting. After a time I stopped thinking about it. The weapon does not question its use.

But the war ended and they sent me home and I was expected to become a man again. I tried. I went back to Virginia and I worked my father's land and I attended church on Sundays and I said the words one says when one is trying to be human. None of it took. The weapon remained, even when there was nothing to cut.

That is why I came out here. That is why I need what she can give me.

A weapon must be used or destroyed. I am choosing destroyed.

*July the Nineteenth*

I have not written in some time. The days blend together. Walk, watch, sleep, wake. The sun rises and sets and rises again and I am still here, still following, still waiting.

She is larger now. Her shoulders have begun to thicken, the first hints of the hump that will develop as she grows. Her coat is still white, impossibly white, as if she were made of a different substance than the other animals. Perhaps she was.

I spoke to her yesterday. I do not know why. She was grazing apart from the others, as she often does in the evenings, and I was sitting on a rise perhaps a hundred yards away, and I spoke. Not loudly—I did not want to startle her—but loud enough that my voice carried across the grass.

I said: I am waiting for you.

She raised her head and looked at me. Her eyes were dark, liquid, the eyes of any buffalo. But there was something in them, or I imagined there was. Recognition, perhaps. Acknowledgment.

Then she lowered her head and returned to her grazing, and I sat on my rise and watched the sun go down.

I do not know what I expected. I do not know what I hoped for. But something passed between us in that moment, something I cannot name.

I will wait as long as I need to wait. A year, two years, however long it takes.

I have nothing else to do. I have no one else to be.
