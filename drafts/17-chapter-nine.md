# Chapter Nine

The world had become unreliable.

I no longer knew which things were real and which were not. The snow was real—I could feel it beneath my horse's hooves, could see it stretching away in all directions. The cold was real—it pressed against me from all sides, a constant presence that never let me forget where I was. But the other things, the things I saw and heard and felt at the edges of my perception, I could not be sure about.

The soldiers were still with me. They had been with me for days now, walking alongside my horse, standing watch while I slept, watching me with their dead eyes and their silent mouths. I had stopped trying to make them go away. They were as much a part of this journey as the snow and the cold.

And they were not the only ones.

I saw Catherine Hardin on the second day out from her grave.

She was walking ahead of me, her dark hair blowing in the wind, her Eastern dress dragging through the snow. She did not look back. She did not speak. She simply walked, and I followed, and the distance between us never changed.

"I'm sorry," I told her. "I came too late. There was nothing I could do."

She did not answer. She never answered.

After a while she faded into the white, and I was alone again—alone with the soldiers and the wind and the endless trail of tracks stretching north.

The memories came without warning.

I would be riding, my mind as empty as the country around me, and suddenly I would be somewhere else. Mexico, usually. The streets of Monterrey, with the guns firing from every window. The slopes of Chapultepec, with the dead piling up at the base of the walls. The long march through country that had been beautiful once and was now nothing but ash and ruin.

I remembered things I had not thought about in years. The face of a man I had killed in the fighting for the Bishop's Palace—young, younger than I was, his eyes wide with surprise as my bayonet went into his chest. The sound a woman made when she found her husband's body in the street, a sound that was not quite screaming and not quite sobbing and not quite anything I had words for. The smell of the hospital tents, where men lay in rows and died by the dozens and the surgeons worked until they could not stand.

I had buried all of this. I had used whiskey and time and the simple practice of not thinking to put it somewhere I did not have to see it. But now the walls I had built were crumbling, and the memories came flooding through, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.

On the third day, I understood something.

It came to me as I sat by my fire, shaking, watching the soldiers watch me. I understood what I was following. Not just a man, not just a white buffalo, but something more. Something that connected him to me, and me to him, in a way I had not recognized before.

We were the same. Not in what we had done—his crimes were his own, and mine were mine—but in what we had become. The war had hollowed us both out, had taken the parts of us that were human and replaced them with something else. We had both learned to kill without feeling, to survive without living, to move through the world like ghosts wearing the shapes of men.

The difference was in what we did with the emptiness.

I had tried to fill it. I had used whiskey and work and the endless small distractions of a life lived day to day. I had told myself that eventually the emptiness would close, that I would feel things again, that I would become the man I had been before Mexico.

He had not tried to fill it. He had accepted it, embraced it, made it the center of his existence. And then he had gone looking for something large enough to give his empty life meaning. A sacred death. An end that would transform everything that came before it.

I did not admire him. I did not sympathize with him. What he had done to the Hardins was monstrous, regardless of the reasons.

But I recognized him. I knew what he was, because I knew what I was. We had both been made in the same forge. We had both come out broken.

The only difference was the way we chose to break.

The trail led north, always north.

The tracks were clearer now, fresher—he was slowing down, stopping more often, perhaps waiting for something. The weather had been clear for days, and the snow showed every mark. Buffalo tracks, deep and regular. Human tracks, lighter but just as steady. Two creatures moving together across the empty land.

I followed. I did not think anymore about why. The reasons had fallen away somewhere back along the trail, lost in the snow like everything else. What remained was motion. What remained was the simple, animal need to see this thing through to the end.

Somewhere up ahead, the man who followed the white buffalo waited for whatever he was waiting for.

That night I dreamed of Chapultepec.

The dream was not like the memories that came during the day. It was vivid, immediate, as real as anything I had experienced while awake. I was there, on the slopes of the fortress, with the Mexican guns firing down and the men around me falling and the wall rising up above us like a cliff.

We climbed. That was what we did at Chapultepec—we climbed. Straight up the walls, using ladders that were too short and ropes that broke and our bare hands when there was nothing else. Men died on my left and my right, shot by the defenders above, and still we climbed.

I reached the top. I pulled myself over the wall and into the fortress, and I found myself in a room full of men. They were young—cadets, I realized later, boys from the military academy that stood on the heights. They could not have been more than fifteen or sixteen years old.

They fought. They had swords and bayonets and the courage of children who do not understand what death means. They fought, and we killed them. All of them. Every one.

I did not remember, afterward, how many I had killed. I did not want to remember. But in the dream, I knew. In the dream, I saw their faces one by one, saw the light go out of their eyes, felt my hands doing what my hands had learned to do.

And when it was over, when the room was silent and the bodies lay in heaps and the smoke hung thick in the air, I looked down at my hands and they were covered in blood. They have been covered in blood ever since.

I woke in the darkness, gasping, my heart pounding in my chest. The fire had burned down to coals. The cold pressed in from all sides. And somewhere to the north, a man was waiting to die.

I got up and saddled my horse and rode on into the dark.

The sun rose on a landscape I did not recognize.

The hills had given way to something flatter, more open—a wide valley stretching between ridges that seemed too far away to matter. The snow was deep here, untouched by wind, a blank white page on which only two stories were written: the tracks of the buffalo, and the tracks of the man who followed her.

I could see them both now. Far ahead, perhaps a mile, a dark shape moved against the white—the buffalo, grazing or walking or simply standing. And behind her, smaller, barely visible, another shape. A man.

I stopped my horse and watched. The distance was too great to make out details, but I could see the way he moved—slow, deliberate, as if every step required careful thought. He was watching her, I knew. Waiting for something.

I did not call out to him. I did not spur my horse forward. I simply watched, as he watched, as the white buffalo stood in the snow and waited for whatever was coming.

The soldiers had gathered around me, more of them than before. Catherine Hardin was among them now.

The silence was not silent. I knew that now.

There was the wind, always the wind, hissing across the snow, finding every gap in my clothing, speaking in a voice that might have been words if I could only understand them. There was the crunch of hooves on the frozen surface, and the creak of leather, and the horse's breathing, heavy and labored. There was the blood in my own ears, loud as a drum.

And underneath it all, like a bass note too low to hear, there was the silence itself—the vast emptiness of the country pressing in from all sides, the weight of all that nothing bearing down on me until I felt I might be crushed by it.

Only the living made noise in this country, and there were so few of us left.

I rode forward, slowly, keeping my distance. I did not know what I was going to do when I reached him. I did not know if there was anything left to do.

But I kept riding. One step at a time, one yard at a time, into the white.
